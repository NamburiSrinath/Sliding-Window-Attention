SECTION 1.
Section 11165.1 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
11165.1.
(a) (1) (A) (i) A health care practitioner authorized to prescribe, order, administer, furnish, or dispense Schedule II, Schedule III, or Schedule IV controlled substances pursuant to Section 11150 shall, before January 1, 2016, or upon receipt of a federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) registration, whichever occurs later, submit an application developed by the Department of Justice to obtain approval to access information online regarding the controlled substance history of a patient that is stored on the Internet and maintained within the Department of Justice, and, upon approval, the department shall release to that practitioner the electronic history of controlled substances dispensed to an individual under his or her care based on data contained in the CURES Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP).

Actual Output
Existing law requires certain health care practitioners and pharmacists to apply to the Department of Justice to obtain approval to access information contained in the Controlled Substance Utilization Review and Evaluation System (CURES) Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) regarding the controlled substance history of a patient under his or her care. Existing law requires the Department of Justice, upon approval of an application, to provide the approved health care practitioner or pharmacist the history of controlled substances dispensed to an individual under his or her care. Existing law authorizes an application to be denied, or a subscriber to be suspended, for specified reasons, including, among others, a subscriber accessing information for any reason other than caring for his or her patients.
This bill would also authorize an individual designated to investigate a holder of a professional license to apply to the Department of Justice to obtain approval to access information contained in the CURES PDMP regarding the controlled substance history of an applicant or a licensee for the purpose of investigating the alleged substance abuse of a licensee. The bill would, upon approval of an application, require the department to provide to the approved individual the history of controlled substances dispensed to the licensee. The bill would clarify that only a subscriber who is a health care practitioner or a pharmacist may have an application denied or be suspended for accessing subscriber information for any reason other than caring for his or her patients. The bill would also specify that an application may be denied, or a subscriber may be suspended, if a subscriber who has been designated to investigate the holder of a professional license accesses information for any reason other than investigating the holder of a professional license.

Actual Output
The existing restructuring of the electrical industry within the Public Utilities Act provides for the establishment of an Independent System Operator and a Power Exchange as nonprofit public benefit corporations. Existing law requires the Independent System Operator to ensure efficient use and reliable operation of the electrical transmission grid consistent with achieving planning and operating reserve criteria no less stringent than those established by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council and the North American Electric Reliability Council. An Electricity Oversight Board is also established to oversee the Independent System Operator and the Power Exchange in order to ensure the success of electrical restructuring and to ensure a reliable supply of electricity in the transition to a new market structure. Existing law prohibits the Independent System Operator from entering into a multistate entity or regional organization unless the Independent System Operator receives approval from the Electricity Oversight Board.
This bill would authorize the Independent System Operator to enter into a multistate entity or regional organization if that entry is approved by its governing board at a duly noticed public meeting.
Existing law, relative to restructuring of the electrical industry, states the intent of the Legislature with respect to the evolution of the roles of the Independent System Operator and Power Exchange, including to evolve into regional organizations to promote the development of regional electricity transmission markets in the western states and to improve the access of consumers serviced by the Independent System Operator and the Power Exchange to those markets.
This bill would delete references to the Power Exchange in the above-described statement of Legislative intent.
Existing law provides for the disposition of a testator’s property by will. Existing law establishes the Uniform Testamentary Additions to Trusts Act, under which a valid devise of property may be made by will to the trustee or trustees of a trust established or to be established by the testator or by the testator and some other person, commonly referred to as a pour-over will. Existing law provides that the decedent’s property, including property devised by a will, is generally subject to probate administration, except as specified. Existing law establishes simplified procedures for addressing a decedent’s estate valued under $150,000, including authorizing the successor of the decedent to collect property due to the decedent without letters of administration or awaiting probate of a will.
This bill would establish simplified procedures for the distribution of property, real or personal property of any amount or value, devised by a will to the trustee or trustees of a recipient trust, as defined, without procuring letters of administration. The bill would authorize the trustee or trustees of a recipient trust to file a verified petition setting forth specified facts in the superior court of the county in which the estate of the decedent may be administered, and would authorize the court to issue an order that a particular item or items of property pass without administration and are transferred to the petitioner as trustee or trustees of the recipient trust. The bill would require attorneys’ fees for services performed in connection with these provisions to be determined by a private agreement between the attorney and the client, and would specify that attorneys’ fees are not subject to approval by the court.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 7200 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
7200.
(a) There is in the Department of Consumer Affairs a State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind in whom enforcement of this chapter is vested. The board shall consist of seven members appointed by the Governor. One member shall be the Director of Rehabilitation or his or her designated representative. The remaining members shall be persons who have shown a particular interest in dealing with the problems of persons who are blind or visually impaired and at least three of them shall be persons who are blind or visually impaired who use guide dogs.
(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2018, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2018, deletes or extends that date. Notwithstanding any other law, the repeal of this section renders the board subject to review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature.
SEC. 2.
Section 7200.5 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
7200.5.
(a) The board shall have exclusive authority in this state to issue licenses for the instruction of persons who are blind or visually impaired in the use of guide dogs and for the training of guide dogs for use by persons who are blind or visually impaired. It shall also have exclusive authority in this state to issue licenses to operate schools for the training of guide dogs and the instruction of persons who are blind or visually impaired in the use of guide dogs.
(b) (1) Notwithstanding any other law, whenever an individual has received training or instruction from a school outside of this state that is certified by the International Guide Dog Federation or a successor entity, as determined by the board, personnel from that school may provide, in this state, any followup services to that individual with respect to the specific guide dog for whom training or instruction was originally provided outside of this state. The personnel from that school shall notify the board on a form prescribed by the board not less than three business days prior to the time the personnel arrive in this state of their intent to provide followup services. If those services are to be provided due to emergency circumstances, as determined by the school, notification may be provided within 24 hours after the personnel arrive in this state. For purposes of making that determination, emergency circumstances include, but are not limited to, injury to a dog that requires determination as to whether it remains safe for the dog to continue working, an accident involving the dog, or certain sudden changes in behavior that imperil the safety of the handler. The board shall permit the personnel to provide the notification electronically and shall not require the personnel to notify the board of the name of the individual who will be receiving the followup services. However, the board may require a school to provide the name of the individual to whom services have been provided if needed for purposes of investigating the personnel from that school who provided these services, so long as the investigation is conducted based upon reasonable grounds for determining that personnel may have provided substandard care.
(2) (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), prior to providing followup services pursuant to paragraph (1), personnel shall have fingerprints on file with the board.
(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the followup services are provided under emergency circumstances personnel shall have one business day after coming in to the state to meet the requirements of that subparagraph.
(3) Whenever followup services are provided pursuant to paragraph (1), the out-of-state school shall provide written information to the guide dog handler concerning the provisions of this subdivision.
(4) The board may refuse to allow personnel to provide followup services if the personnel have committed any act described in Section 7211.9. During the time the personnel provide followup services to the individual, the personnel shall be subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the board, which may include a citation and fine pursuant to the board’s rules and regulations or any other disciplinary action which could be brought against a licensed instructor.
SEC. 3.
Section 7215.7 is added to the Business and Professions Code, to read:
7215.7.
(a) The board shall prepare a factsheet that shall contain all of the following:
(1) A description of the purposes served by the board.
(2) A description of the board’s role in assisting guide dog users who are victims of alleged guide dog discrimination.
(3) A description of the board’s arbitration procedure under Section 7215.6.
(b) The board shall post the factsheet on its Internet Web site and provide copies to each guide dog school licensed pursuant to this chapter. A school licensed under this chapter shall provide a copy of the factsheet to every student receiving training from that school.
(c) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2018, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2018, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.

Actual Output
Existing law establishes within the Department of Consumer Affairs a State Board of Guide Dogs for the Blind, which is comprised of 7 members appointed by the Governor.
Existing law requires 2 of the board members to be persons who are blind or visually impaired who use guide dogs.
This bill would instead require at least 3 board members to be persons who are blind or visually impaired who use guide dogs.
Under existing law, the board has exclusive authority in this state to issue licenses for the instruction of persons who are blind or visually impaired in the use of guide dogs and for the training of guide dogs for use by persons who are blind or visually impaired. Under existing law, the board also has exclusive authority in this state to issue licenses to operate schools for the training of guide dogs and the instruction of persons who are blind or visually impaired in the use of guide dogs. Existing law makes it unlawful for any person to sell, offer for sale, give, hire, or furnish under any other arrangement, any guide dog or to engage in the business or occupation of training a guide dog unless he or she holds a valid and unimpaired license issued pursuant to the provisions governing guide dogs. A violation of those provisions is a crime.
This bill, whenever an individual has received training or instruction from a specified certified school outside of this state, would authorize personnel from that school to provide that individual with any followup services within this state with respect to the specific guide dog for whom training or instruction was originally provided outside of this state, as specified. The bill would require the personnel, not less than 3 days prior to arriving in this state, to notify the board of their intent to provide those services.
This bill would, if specified conditions are met, authorize followup emergency services. If those services are to be provided due to emergency circumstances, as determined by the school based on specified examples, the bill would authorize that notice to be provided within 24 hours after the personnel arrive in this state. The bill would prohibit the board from requiring the school to provide the name of the individual who will be receiving followup services, however, it would permit the board to require a school to provide the name of the individual to whom services have been provided to investigate personnel providing those services, so long as the investigation is based on reasonable grounds for determining that personnel may have provided substandard care. The bill would also authorize the board to refuse to allow personnel who have committed certain acts for which the board could suspend or revoke a license to provide those services, and would place those personnel under the disciplinary jurisdiction of the board while they provide those services. The bill, until January 1, 2018, would require the board to prepare a factsheet regarding various functions of the board, to post that factsheet on its Internet Web site, and to provide copies to each of the licensed guide dog schools. The bill, until January 1, 2018, would also require a licensed guide dog school to provide copies of the factsheet to every student receiving training from that school. Because the failure of a licensed guide dog school to provide those copies and the failure of personnel to provide that notification would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

(6) When an industrial accident or illness occurs at a time when the full 60 days will overlap into the next fiscal year, the employee shall be entitled to only that amount remaining at the end of the fiscal year in which the injury or illness occurred, for the same illness or injury.
(c) The industrial accident or illness leave of absence is to be used in lieu of entitlement acquired under Section 45191. When entitlement to industrial accident or illness leave has been exhausted, entitlement or other sick leave will then be used; but if an employee is receiving workers’ compensation the employee shall be entitled to use only so much of his or her accumulated or available sick leave, accumulated compensating time, vacation or other available leave that, when added to the workers’ compensation award, provide for a full day’s wage or salary.
(d) The governing board of a district may, by rule or regulation, provide for as much additional leave of absence, paid or unpaid, as it deems appropriate and during this leave the employee may return to his or her position without suffering any loss of status or benefits.

(g) When all available leaves of absence, paid or unpaid, have been exhausted and if the employee is not medically able to assume the duties of his or her position, the employee shall, if not placed in another position, be placed on a reemployment list for a period of 39 months. When available, during the 39-month period, the employee shall be employed in a vacant position in the class of the employee’s previous assignment over all other available candidates except for a reemployment list established because of lack of work or lack of funds, in which case the employee shall be listed in accordance with appropriate seniority regulations.
(h) The governing board of a district may require that an employee serve or have served continuously a specified period of time with the district before the benefits provided by this section are made available to the employee provided that this period shall not exceed three years and that all service of the employee prior to the effective date of this section shall be credited in determining compliance with the requirement.
(i) In the absence of rules and regulations adopted by the governing board of a district, pursuant to this section, an employee shall be entitled to industrial and accident or illness leave as provided in this section but without limitation as to the number of days of this leave and without any requirement of a specified period of service.
(j) An employee who has been placed on a reemployment list, as provided in this section, who has been medically released for return to duty and who fails to accept an appropriate assignment shall be dismissed.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) All pupils deserve and need safe and supportive school environments in which to learn.
(2) Despite much progress, California lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) pupils often face verbal, physical, and online harassment, which has significant effects on their academic achievement.
(3) In the Gay Lesbian & Straight Education Network’s (GLSEN) 2013 National School Climate Survey, 91 percent of California LGBTQ pupils reported hearing anti-LGBTQ remarks, 7 in 10 reported being called names or threatened based on their sexual orientation, nearly one-third reported physical harassment or assault, and 46 percent reported cyberbullying.
(4) These problems have direct effects on pupils’ school performance. GLSEN survey data shows that the average grade point average for LGBTQ pupils who have experienced harassment is significantly lower than for LGBTQ pupils who have not, and that 30 percent of LGBTQ pupils report frequently skipping class or missing whole days of school because they felt unsafe at school.
(5) In spite of these problems, research has shown that LGBTQ pupils who are harassed or assaulted in school do not report these incidents to school staff, primarily because they believe school staff will not do anything about the problem.
(6) Creating supportive learning environments for LGBTQ pupils improves pupil performance. Pupils in schools with peer support clubs report less harassment and assault, are more likely to report incidents when they occur, and are less likely to miss school because of safety concerns.
(7) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) monitors and funds local efforts to provide professional development for educators on safe and supportive environments for LGBTQ pupils, foster schoolsite resources such as Gay Straight Alliance clubs and “safe spaces” for LGBTQ pupils, and promote referrals to school and community health professionals with experience providing support to LGBTQ pupils.
(8) CDC data shows that only 50 percent of California schools facilitate access to schoolsite and community health resources for LGBTQ pupils, and only 39 percent have peer support clubs.
(b) The Legislature therefore encourages school districts, county offices of education, and charter schools to provide information on existing schoolsite and community resources as required by subdivision (d) of Section 234.1 of the Education Code as part of a more comprehensive effort to educate school staff on the support of LGBTQ pupils.
SEC. 2.
Section 234.1 of the Education Code is amended to read:
234.1.
The department, pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 64001, shall monitor adherence to the requirements of Chapter 5.3 (commencing with Section 4900) of Division 1 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations and this chapter as part of its regular monitoring and review of local educational agencies, commonly known as the Categorical Program Monitoring process. The department shall assess whether local educational agencies have done all of the following:
(a) Adopted a policy that prohibits discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on the actual or perceived characteristics set forth in Section 422.55 of the Penal Code and Section 220 of this code, and disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. The policy shall include a statement that the policy applies to all acts related to school activity or school attendance occurring within a school under the jurisdiction of the superintendent of the school district.
(b) Adopted a process for receiving and investigating complaints of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying based on any of the actual or perceived characteristics set forth in Section 422.55 of the Penal Code and Section 220 of this code, and disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics. The complaint process shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following:
(1) A requirement that, if school personnel witness an act of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying, they shall take immediate steps to intervene when safe to do so.
(2) A timeline to investigate and resolve complaints of discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying that shall be followed by all schools under the jurisdiction of the school district.
(3) An appeal process afforded to the complainant should he or she disagree with the resolution of a complaint filed pursuant to this section.
(4) All forms developed pursuant to this process shall be translated pursuant to Section 48985.
(c) Publicized antidiscrimination, antiharassment, anti-intimidation, and antibullying policies adopted pursuant to subdivision (a), including information about the manner in which to file a complaint, to pupils, parents, employees, agents of the governing board, and the general public. The information shall be translated pursuant to Section 48985.
(d) Provided, incident to the publicizing described in subdivision (c), to certificated schoolsite employees who serve pupils in any of grades 7 to 12, inclusive, who are employed by the local educational agency, information on existing schoolsite and community resources related to the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) pupils. Schoolsite resources may include, but are not limited to, peer support or affinity clubs and organizations, safe spaces for LGBTQ pupils, counseling services, staff who have received antibias or other training aimed at supporting these pupils or who serve as designated support to these pupils, health and other curriculum materials that are inclusive of, and relevant to, these pupils, online training developed pursuant to Section 32283.5, and other policies adopted pursuant to this article, including related complaint procedures. Community resources may include, but are not limited to, community-based organizations that provide support to LGBTQ pupils and their families, and physical and mental health providers with experience or training in treating or supporting these pupils.
(e) Posted the policy established pursuant to subdivision (a) in all schools and offices, including staff lounges and pupil government meeting rooms.
(f) Maintained documentation of complaints and their resolution for a minimum of one review cycle.
(g) Ensured that complainants are protected from retaliation and that the identity of a complainant alleging discrimination, harassment, intimidation, or bullying remains confidential, as appropriate.
(h) Identified a responsible local educational agency officer for ensuring school district or county office of education compliance with the requirements of Chapter 5.3 (commencing with Section 4900) of Division 1 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations and this chapter.

Existing law establishes the system of public elementary and secondary schools in this state, and provides for the establishment of local educational agencies to operate these schools and provide instruction to pupils. Existing law states the policy of the State of California to afford all persons in public schools, regardless of their disability, gender, gender identity, gender expression, nationality, race or ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or any other specified characteristic, equal rights and opportunities in the educational institutions of the state. Existing law, the Safe Place to Learn Act, requires the State Department of Education, as part of its regular monitoring and review of a local educational agency, to assess whether the local educational agency has, among other things, adopted a policy that prohibits discrimination, harassment, intimidation, and bullying, as specified, and has publicized that policy to pupils, parents, employees, agents of the governing board, and the general public.
This bill would require the department to also assess whether the local educational agency has provided to certificated schoolsite employees who serve pupils in any of grades 7 to 12, inclusive, information on existing schoolsite and community resources related to the support of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning pupils, as specified.

Under existing law, except as specified, a person is liable for physical invasion of privacy when that person knowingly enters onto the land of another person without permission or otherwise trespasses to capture any type of visual image, sound recording, or other physical impression of a person engaging in a private, personal, or familial activity and the invasion occurs in a manner that is offensive to a reasonable person. Under existing law, a person is liable for constructive invasion of privacy for the same activity, as specified, through the use of any device, regardless of whether there is a physical trespass. Existing law subjects a person who commits physical or constructive invasion of privacy to specified damages and civil fines.
This bill would expand liability for physical invasion of privacy to additionally include a person knowingly entering into the airspace above the land of another person without permission, as provided.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) According to United States Census Bureau, California has a poverty rate of 23.5 percent, the highest rate of any state in the country.
(b) Children born into poverty are at higher risk of health and developmental disparities, including, but not limited to, premature birth, low birth weight, infant mortality, crime, domestic violence, developmental delays, dropping out of high school, substance abuse, unemployment, and child abuse and neglect.
(c) In 2014, the Legislature passed Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 155 by Assembly Member Raul Bocanegra, recognizing that research over the last two decades in the evolving fields of neuroscience, molecular biology, public health, genomics, and epigenetics reveals that experiences in the first few years of life build changes into the biology of the human body that, in turn, influence the person’s physical and mental health over his or her lifetime.
(d) On May 3, 2012, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. issued Executive Order B-19-12, establishing the “Let’s Get Healthy California Task Force” to develop a 10-year plan for improving the health of Californians, controlling health care costs, promoting personal responsibility for individual health, and advancing health equity.
(e) The task force identified several priorities, including a subset for “Healthy Beginnings,” which include reducing infant deaths, increasing vaccination rates, reducing childhood trauma, and reducing adolescent tobacco use.
(f) The final report of the task force states, “the challenge going forward is to identify evidence-based interventions and quicken the pace of uptake across the state” in order to meet the ambitious goals in the Governor’s directive.
(g) Voluntary evidence-based home visiting programs, such as Nurse-Family Partnership, Healthy Families America, Early Head Start (Home-Based Program Option), Parents as Teachers, and Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters, strengthen the critical parent-child relationship and connect families with information and resources during the pivotal time from pregnancy to five years of age. Extensive research has shown that evidence-based home visiting programs serving pregnant and parenting mothers, prenatal to the child turning five years of age, increase family self-sufficiency, positive parenting practices, child literacy and school readiness, and maternal and child health.
(h) Voluntary evidence-based home visiting program models focused on the prenatal period to five years of age range from low to high intensity, reflecting the broad spectrum of family needs that home visiting can impact. Many experts hail home visiting program diversity as essential to providing parents with choices and ensuring that programs are well matched with local needs and strengths, as well as responsive to the diverse needs of California’s children and families.
(i) In 2013, more than 248,000 Medi-Cal beneficiaries gave birth to a child. Because Medi-Cal covers half of all births in the state, this has increased costs for taxpayers. Medi-Cal expansion has resulted in an 18 percent increase in Medi-Cal enrollment to a total of 11.3 million, and enrollment is expected to exceed 12 million in 2015.
(j) The California Health and Human Services Agency recently submitted its State Health Care Innovation Plan, including the Maternity Care initiative, which addresses issues of high costs in maternity care, to the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. Child deliveries and related expenses, including high-risk births, rank among the top 10 high-cost episodes of health care, and in the last 15 years, California has seen a continual rise in maternal mortality.
(k) The cost of health care specifically related to high-risk pregnancies, neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU) services, toxic stress, and emergency room visits has increased and is projected to continue to rise. Average health care costs for women were 25 percent more than men primarily due to higher costs of health care during childbearing years.
(l) With more than three decades of evidence from randomized, controlled trials and rigorous followup evaluation studies, evidence-based home visiting programs have demonstrated sustained improvements in maternal health, child health, positive parenting practices, child development and school readiness, reductions in child maltreatment, family economic self-sufficiency, linkages and referrals, and reductions in family violence.
(m) Evidence-based home visiting programs have specifically demonstrated reductions in preterm births, preventable maternal mortality, smoking during pregnancy, complications of pregnancy, closely spaced subsequent births, childhood injuries resulting in costly emergency department use and hospitalizations, improved childhood immunization rates, compliance with well child visit schedules, lower body mass index rates, higher birth weights, and improved family well-being, including increased family health literacy, and parent self-help development. As a result of families benefiting from evidence-based home visiting, there have been cost savings to federal, state, and local governments with respect to programs and services, including Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program.
(n) The strong evidence of effectiveness and predictable return on investment demonstrate that evidence-based home visiting programs should be brought to scale in California to improve maternal and child health outcomes and help reduce health care costs for generations to come.
(o) By supporting families from the start, voluntary evidence-based home visiting programs serving families from prenatal to five years of age provide a foundation for subsequent early childhood programs and family support efforts to build upon, and can help ensure that families are well-equipped to raise California’s next generation of productive, healthy, and successful adults.
(p) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to develop a means to leverage public and private dollars to substantially expand the scale of evidence-based home visiting programs throughout California, beginning with communities and populations with the greatest need.
SEC. 2.
Section 14148.25 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
14148.25.
(a) The department shall, in consultation with stakeholders, including, but not limited to, representatives from Medi-Cal managed care plans, public and private hospitals, evidence-based home visiting programs, and other governmental entities including local and state law enforcement and corrections agencies, local and state social services agencies, and local and state educational agencies, develop a feasibility plan on or before January 1, 2017, that describes the costs, benefits, and any potential barriers related to offering evidence-based home visiting programs to Medi-Cal eligible pregnant and parenting women. The department shall consult with stakeholders from diverse geographical regions of the state. The department shall consider all of the following in developing the plan:
(1) Establishing Medi-Cal coverage for evidence-based home visiting program services.
(2) Incentives for Medi-Cal providers to offer evidence-based home visiting program services.
(3) Other mechanisms to fund evidence-based home visiting program services for Medi-Cal eligible pregnant and parenting women.
(4) Identifying among evidence-based home visiting programs those with established evidence to improve health outcomes, the experience of care, and cost savings to the health care system.
(b) In developing the plan, the department shall prioritize the identification of funding sources, other than General Fund moneys, to fund evidence-based home visiting program services, including local, federal, or private funds, or any other funds made available for these program services.
(c) For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) “Evidence-based program” means a program that is based on scientific evidence demonstrating that the program model is effective. An evidence-based program shall be reviewed on site and compared to program model standards by the model developer or the developer’s designee at least every five years to ensure that the program continues to maintain fidelity with the program model. The program model shall have had demonstrated and replicated significant and sustained positive outcomes that have been in one or more well-designed and rigorous randomized controlled research designs, and the evaluation results shall have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
(2) “Evidence-based home visiting program” means a program or initiative that does all of the following:
(A) Meets, on or before April 1, 2015, the United States Department of Health and Human Services Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) criteria, as described in Section 511(d)(3)(A)(i)(l) of Title V of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 711).
(B) Contains home visiting as a primary service delivery strategy by providers satisfying home visiting program requirements to provide services to families with a pregnant or parenting woman who is eligible for medical assistance.
(C) Offers services on a voluntary basis to pregnant women, expectant fathers, and parents and caregivers of children from prenatal to five years of age.
(D) Targets participant outcomes that include all of the following:
(i) Improved maternal and child health.
(ii) Prevention of child injuries, child abuse or maltreatment, and reduction of emergency department visits.
(iii) Improvements in school readiness and achievement.
(iv) Reduction in crime or domestic violence.
(v) Improvements in family economic self-sufficiency.
(vi) Improvements in coordination of, and referrals to, other community resources and support.
(vii) Improvements in parenting skills related to child development.

Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services, including perinatal services for pregnant women.
Existing law establishes the Nurse-Family Partnership program, which is administered by the State Department of Public Health, to provide grants for voluntary nurse home visiting programs for expectant first-time mothers, their children, and their families. Under existing law, a county is required to satisfy specified requirements in order to be eligible to receive a grant.
This bill would require the State Department of Health Care Services, in consultation with specified stakeholders, to develop a feasibility plan on or before January 1, 2017, that describes the costs, benefits, and any potential barriers related to offering evidence-based home visiting programs to Medi-Cal eligible pregnant and parenting women. The bill would also require the department, in developing the plan, to consider, among other things, establishing Medi-Cal coverage for evidence-based home visiting program services and incentives for Medi-Cal providers to offer those services, and would require the department, in developing the plan, to prioritize the identification of funding sources, other than General Fund moneys, to fund evidence-based home visiting program services.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares that the oversight boards to individual successor agencies were established pursuant to the Redevelopment Agency Dissolution Act, which prescribes that all oversight boards in the County of Los Angeles will be consolidated into a single countywide oversight board by July 1, 2016.
(b) The Legislature further finds that collapsing all functions of the 71 oversight boards in the County of Los Angeles into a single countywide oversight board would create administrative gridlock and be a severe impediment to the expeditious disposition of properties owned by former redevelopment agencies.
(c) In recognition of these findings and to ensure that the duties of the 71 oversight boards and successor agencies in the County of Los Angeles will be met in a timely manner, it is the intent of the Legislature to continue all oversight boards in the County of Los Angeles in existence until the respective successor agency requests dissolution of its oversight board and transfer of fiduciary duties to the countywide oversight board.
SEC. 2.
Section 34179 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
34179.
(a) Each successor agency shall have an oversight board composed of seven members.

Members shall be selected as follows:
(1) One member appointed by the county board of supervisors.
(2) One member appointed by the mayor for the city that formed the redevelopment agency.

(6) One member of the public appointed by the county board of supervisors.
(7) One member representing the employees of the former redevelopment agency appointed by the mayor or chair of the board of supervisors from the recognized employee organization representing the largest number of former redevelopment agency employees employed by the successor agency at that time. If city or county employees performed administrative duties of the former redevelopment agency, the appointment shall be made from the recognized employee organization representing those employees. If a recognized employee organization does not exist for either the employees of the former redevelopment agency or the city or county employees performing administrative duties of the former redevelopment agency, the appointment shall be made from among the employees of the successor agency. In voting to approve a contract as an enforceable obligation, a member appointed pursuant to this paragraph shall not be deemed to be interested in the contract by virtue of being an employee of the successor agency or community for purposes of Section 1090 of the Government Code.
(8) If the county or a joint powers agency formed the redevelopment agency, the largest city by acreage in the territorial jurisdiction of the former redevelopment agency may select one member. If there are no cities with territory in a project area of the redevelopment agency, the county superintendent of education may appoint an additional member to represent the public.
(9) If there are no special districts of the type that are eligible to receive property tax pursuant to Section 34188 within the territorial jurisdiction of the former redevelopment agency, the county may appoint one member to represent the public.
(10) If a redevelopment agency was formed by an entity that is both a charter city and a county, the oversight board shall be composed of seven members selected as follows: three members appointed by the mayor of the city, if that appointment is subject to confirmation by the county board of supervisors; one member appointed by the largest special district, by property tax share, with territory in the territorial jurisdiction of the former redevelopment agency, that is the type of special district that is eligible to receive property tax revenues pursuant to Section 34188; one member appointed by the county superintendent of education to represent schools; one member appointed by the Chancellor of the California Community Colleges to represent community college districts; and one member representing employees of the former redevelopment agency appointed by the mayor of the city, if that appointment is subject to confirmation by the county board of supervisors, to represent the largest number of former redevelopment agency employees employed by the successor agency at that time.
(b) The Governor may appoint individuals to fill any oversight board member position described in subdivision (a) that has not been filled by May 15, 2012, or any member position that remains vacant for more than 60 days.
(c) The oversight board may direct the staff of the successor agency to perform work in furtherance of the oversight board’s duties and responsibilities under this part. The successor agency shall pay for all of the costs of meetings of the oversight board and may include those costs in its administrative budget.

An action shall become effective five business days after notice in the manner specified by the department is provided unless the department requests a review. Each oversight board shall designate an official to whom the department may make those requests and who shall provide the department with the telephone number and email contact information for the purpose of communicating with the department pursuant to this subdivision. Except as otherwise provided in this part, if the department requests a review of a given oversight board action, it shall have 40 days from the date of its request to approve the oversight board action or return it to the oversight board for reconsideration and the oversight board action shall not be effective until approved by the department. If the department returns the oversight board action to the oversight board for reconsideration, the oversight board shall resubmit the modified action for department approval and the modified oversight board action shall not become effective until approved by the department. If the department reviews a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule, the department may eliminate or modify any item on that schedule prior to its approval. The county auditor-controller shall reflect the actions of the department in determining the amount of property tax revenues to allocate to the successor agency. The department shall provide notice to the successor agency and the county auditor-controller as to the reasons for its actions. To the extent that an oversight board continues to dispute a determination with the department, one or more future recognized obligation schedules may reflect any resolution of that dispute. The department may also agree to an amendment to a Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule to reflect a resolution of a disputed item, however, this shall not affect a past allocation of property tax or create a liability for any affected taxing entity.
(i) Oversight boards shall have fiduciary responsibilities to holders of enforceable obligations and the taxing entities that benefit from distributions of property tax and other revenues pursuant to Section 34188. Further, the provisions of Division 4 (commencing with Section 1000)

Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies, subject to review by oversight boards, and to, among other things, make payments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations required pursuant to any enforceable obligation. Existing law authorizes, in each county where more than one oversight board was created, only one oversight board to be appointed on and after July 1, 2016.
This bill would require an oversight board within the County of Los Angeles to continue to independently operate past the July 1, 2016, consolidation date, until its successor agency adopts a resolution dissolving the board and the board approves that resolution, as provided.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the County of Los Angeles.

SECTION 1.
Section 49013 of the Education Code is amended to read:
49013.

(b) A complaint may be filed anonymously if the complaint provides evidence or information leading to evidence to support an allegation of noncompliance with the requirements of this article.
(c) A complainant not satisfied with the decision of a public school may appeal the decision to the department and shall receive a written appeal decision within 60 days of the department’s receipt of the appeal.
(d) If a public school finds merit in a complaint, or the department finds merit in an appeal, the public school shall provide a remedy to all affected pupils, parents, and guardians that, where applicable, includes reasonable efforts by the public school to ensure full reimbursement to all affected pupils, parents, and guardians, subject to procedures established through regulations adopted by the state board.
(e) Information regarding the requirements of this article shall be included in the annual notification distributed to pupils, parents and guardians, employees, and other interested parties pursuant to Section 4622 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations.
(f) Public schools shall establish local policies and procedures to implement the provisions of this section on or before March 1, 2013. A public school shall not establish a local policy or procedure pursuant to this subdivision that authorizes the public school to resolve a complaint filed pursuant to this section, whether formally or informally, by providing a remedy to the complainant without also providing a remedy to all affected pupils, parents, and guardians, as required by subdivision (d).
(g) The Superintendent shall have all power and authority necessary to ensure that, when the department finds merit in an appeal filed pursuant to this section, the complaint is resolved pursuant to subdivision (d) in a timely manner.
(h) If the department finds merit in an appeal filed pursuant to this section, the department’s written decision shall identify with specificity the corrective action that the public school shall take to confirm that it has provided a remedy to all affected pupils, including, if applicable, specific direction regarding the reasonable efforts the public school shall take to ensure full reimbursement to all affected pupils.
(i) If the public school failed to address an issue raised in the complaint filed pursuant to this section in the public school’s decision about that complaint, the department shall require the public school to respond to the issue within 10 business days and, after providing this opportunity to respond, the department shall make findings on the merit of the appeal without remanding the complaint to the public school for further consideration, regardless of whether the public school provided the required response.
(j) If the complainant submits evidence in conjunction with the appeal that is related to an issue raised in the underlying complaint and that is presented for the first time on appeal, the department shall determine whether there is merit in the appeal regardless of the newly submitted evidence. If the department determines there is merit in the appeal, the department shall resolve the underlying complaint. If the department determines there is not merit in the appeal, the department shall send the underlying complaint and new evidence back to the public school for further consideration.
(k) If the complainant raises one or more issues on appeal that were not presented in the underlying complaint, the department shall remand any new issue to the public school to treat as a newly filed complaint as provided in this section, but shall resolve the remainder of the appeal as provided in this section.
(l) A public school shall provide to the department, within 60 days of the department’s written decision, evidence documenting that the public school has complied with any corrective action specified in the written decision and the requirements of subdivision (d).
(m) If the public school has not satisfied the requirement in subdivision (l), the superintendent of the school district or the county office of education or the principal of the charter school, as appropriate based on the public school involved in the underlying complaint, shall appear at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the governing board or body of the public school to explain the public school’s failure to satisfy that requirement.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.

Actual Output
Existing law prohibits a pupil enrolled in a public school from being required to pay a pupil fee for participation in an educational activity. Existing law authorizes a complaint of noncompliance to be filed with the principal of a school for violation of that prohibition, as specified, and required public schools to establish local policies and procedures to implement the complaint provisions.
This bill would prohibit a public school from establishing a local policy or procedure that authorizes the public school to resolve a complaint by providing a remedy to the complainant without also providing a remedy to all affected pupils, parents, and guardians, as provided. The bill would authorize the Superintendent of Public Instruction to ensure that an appeal that the State Department of Education finds merit in is resolved in a timely manner, as specified. The bill would establish procedures for appeals, including, among others, requiring a public school to provide to the department, within 60 days of the department’s written decision, evidence documenting that the public school has complied with any corrective action specified in the written decision. By imposing additional duties on public schools and local educational agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

The Public Employees’ Retirement Law authorizes a public agency to participate in, and make all or part of its employees members of, the Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) by a contract entered into between its governing body and the board of administration of the system. The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) requires a public retirement system, as defined, to modify its plan or plans to comply with the act and, among other provisions, establishes new retirement formulas for employees first hired on or after January 1, 2013, as specified.
This bill would authorize a public agency that has contracted with the board of administration of PERS to offer an alternative formula from that required by PEPRA, to be applicable to miscellaneous, nonsafety employees hired after January 1, 2017,
and who are new members, as defined,
if specified contingencies are satisfied, including that the agency and representative employee organization have agreed to its application in a valid memorandum of understanding.
The bill would require that miscellaneous, nonsafety employees who are not new members, as defined, if they are employed by a public employer that did not contract with PERS prior to December 31, 2012, be covered by the default benefit formula under PEPRA. The bill would specify what is pensionable compensation for these purposes.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares the following:
(a) The State of California has officially recognized the Armenian Genocide each year for decades and has repeatedly urged the Republic of Turkey to acknowledge the facts of the Armenian Genocide and work toward a just resolution, honor its obligations under international treaties and human rights laws, to end all forms of religious discrimination and persecution, and to return Christian church properties to their rightful owners.
(b) Genocide is defined by the United Nations as an act “committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.
(c) Genocide denial is widely viewed as among the final stages of genocide and serves to perpetuate the effects of genocide even after the active phases of extermination, massacres, forced marches, and deportation has ended.
(d) The government of Turkey has engaged and continues to engage in an ongoing campaign of genocide denial and historical revisionism by refusing to acknowledge its responsibility for the Armenian Genocide, refusing to compensate its victims, and actively pursuing a well-funded political lobbying campaign throughout the United States, including in California, to rewrite history and defeat legislation recognizing the Armenian Genocide.
(e) The government of Turkey has engaged and continues to engage in efforts to effect Armenian cultural erasure since the founding of the Republic of Turkey, including, but not limited to, ethnic cleansings and the destruction of sacred Armenian religious sites.
(f) Reference in Turkey by any scholar, journalist, or other person to the massacre and deportation of Armenians in 1915 to 1923, inclusive, as genocide can be criminally prosecuted under Article 301 of the Turkish Penal Code.
(g) The State of California is home to the largest Armenian-American population in the United States, and Armenians living in California, most of whom are direct descendants of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide, have enriched our state through their leadership and contributions in business, agriculture, academia, government, and the arts, yet continue to suffer the effects of the continued denial campaign by the government of Turkey.
(h) The State of California, as the world’s eighth largest economy, and in accordance with principles of human rights and justice, has taken the lead in adopting legislation to divest from South Africa for its policy of apartheid, Sudan for its genocide in Darfur, and Iran for its support of international terrorism, imposing economic consequences upon regimes that engage in conduct and policy that violate human rights or constitute crimes against humanity.
(i) The State of California, through its Public Employees’ Retirement System (PERS) and its State Teachers’ Retirement System (STRS), directly invests public funds in the government of Turkey, which then reaps profits while actively denying the Armenian Genocide, funding its continued campaign of denial, at least in part, through these investments in its economy.
(j) By investing public funds in the government of Turkey, the State of California as the embodiment of its citizens contradicts its longstanding, just position of recognizing the Armenian Genocide and urging the government of Turkey to acknowledge its responsibility and work toward a just resolution by honoring its obligations under international treaties and human rights laws, to end all forms of religious discrimination and persecution, and to return Christian church properties to their rightful owners.
(k) It is the government of Turkey, not the people of Turkey, that is responsible for Turkey’s continued egregious violations of human rights and active pursuit of genocide denial, cultural erasure, and historical revisionism.
(l) PERS currently has investment holdings in bonds directly issued by the Republic of Turkey in excess of $185,000,000.
(m) STRS currently has investment holdings in bonds directly issued by the Republic of Turkey in excess of several hundred million dollars.
(n) Investment in the Republic of Turkey enables its government to continue to deny justice to the Armenian people.
(o) Divesting these funds would ensure that the State of California is in no way complicit in the continued denial of the Armenian Genocide by the government of Turkey and would encourage said government to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide and to reach a fair and just resolution of reparations for the survivors of the Armenian Genocide.
SEC. 2.
Section 7513.75 is added to the Government Code, to read:
7513.75.
(a) As used in this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) “Board” means the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System or the Teachers’ Retirement Board of the State Teachers’ Retirement System, as applicable.
(2) “Government of Turkey” means the government of Turkey or its instrumentalities or political subdivisions. “Government of Turkey” also includes any and all investment vehicles, government bonds, or financial institutions and entities that are owned, controlled, or operated by the government of Turkey.
(3) “Turkey” means the Republic of Turkey or any territory under the administration or control of Turkey.
(4)  “Public employee retirement funds” means the Public Employees’ Retirement Fund described in Section 20062 and the Teachers’ Retirement Fund described in Section 22167 of the Education Code.
(b) The board shall not invest public employee retirement funds in any investment vehicle in Turkey that meets either of the following criteria:
(1) The investment vehicle is issued by the government of Turkey.
(2) The investment vehicle is owned, controlled, or managed by the government of Turkey.
(c) On or before June 30, 2016, the board shall determine which Turkish investment vehicles are subject to divestment.
(d) After the determination described in subdivision (c), the board shall determine, by the next applicable board meeting, if a Turkish investment vehicle meets the criteria described in subdivision (b). If the board plans to invest or has investments in a company that meets the criteria described in subdivision (b), that planned or existing investment shall be subject to subdivisions (g) and (h).
(e) Investments of the board in an investment vehicle that does not meet the criteria described in subdivision (b) are not subject to subdivision (h) if the company does not subsequently meet the criteria described in subdivision (b). The board shall identify the reasons why that investment vehicle does not satisfy the criteria described in subdivision (b) in the report to the Legislature described in subdivision (i).
(f) (1) Notwithstanding subdivisions (d) and (e), if the board’s investment in a company described in subdivision (b) is limited to investment via an externally and actively managed commingled fund, the board shall contact that fund manager in writing and request that the fund manager remove that investment vehicle from the fund as described in subdivision (h). On or before June 30, 2016, if the fund or account manager creates a fund or account devoid of investment vehicles described in subdivision (b), the transfer of board investments from the prior fund or account to the fund or account devoid of the investment vehicles shall be deemed to satisfy subdivision (h).
(2) If the board’s investment in an investment vehicle described in subdivision (b) is limited to an alternative fund or account, the alternative fund or account manager creates an actively managed commingled fund that excludes investment vehicles described in subdivision (b), and the new fund or account is deemed to be financially equivalent to the existing fund or account, the transfer of board investments from the existing fund or account to the new fund or account shall be deemed to satisfy subdivision (h). If the board determines that the new fund or account is not financially equivalent to the existing fund, the board shall include the reasons for that determination in the report described in subdivision (i).
(3) The board shall make a good faith effort to identify any private equity investments that involve investment vehicles described in subdivision (b), or are linked to the government of Turkey. If the board determines that a private equity investment clearly involves an investment vehicle described in subdivision (b), or is linked to the government of Turkey, the board shall consider, at its discretion, if those private equity investments shall be subject to subdivision (h). If the board determines that a private equity investment clearly involves a company described in subdivision (b), or is linked to the government of Turkey and the board does not take action as described in subdivision (h), the board shall include the reasons for its decision in the report described in subdivision (i).
(g) Except as described in subdivisions (e) and (f), the board, in the board’s capacity of shareholder or investor, shall notify any investment vehicle described in subdivision (d) that the investment vehicle is subject to subdivision (h) and permit that investment vehicle to respond to the board. The board shall request that the investment vehicle take substantial action to disassociate itself from the government of Turkey no later than 90 days from the date the board notified the investment vehicle under this subdivision. If the board determines that an investment vehicle has taken substantial action or has made sufficient progress toward substantial action before the expiration of that 90-day period, that investment vehicle shall not be subject to subdivision (h). The board shall, at intervals not to exceed 90 days, continue to monitor and review the progress of the investment vehicle until that investment vehicle has taken substantial action in Turkey. An investment vehicle that fails to complete substantial action within one year from the date of the initial notice by the board shall be subject to subdivision (h).
(h) If an investment vehicle described in subdivision (d) fails to complete substantial action by the time described in subdivision (g), the board shall take the following actions:
(1) The board shall not make additional or new investments or renew existing investments in that investment vehicle.
(2) The board shall liquidate the investments of the board in that investment vehicle no later than 18 months after this subdivision applies to that investment vehicle. The board shall liquidate those investments in a manner to address the need for investment vehicles to take substantial action in Turkey and consistent with the board’s fiduciary responsibilities as described in Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
(i) On or before January 1, 2017, and every year thereafter, the board shall file a report with the Legislature. The report shall describe the following:
(1) A list of investments the board has in investment vehicles that satisfy the criteria in subdivision (b), including, but not limited to, the issuer, by name, of the stock, bonds, securities, and other evidence of indebtedness.
(2) A detailed summary of the association between an investment vehicle described in paragraph (1) and the government of Turkey.
(3) Whether the board has reduced its investments in an investment vehicle that satisfies the criteria in subdivision (b).
(4)  If the board has not completely reduced its investments in an investment vehicle that satisfies the criteria in subdivision (b), when the board anticipates that the board will reduce all investments in that investment vehicle or the reasons why a sale or transfer of investments is inconsistent with the fiduciary responsibilities of the board as described in Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
(5) Any information described in subdivisions (d) and (e).
(6) A detailed summary of investments that were transferred to funds or accounts devoid of Turkish investment vehicles as described in subdivision (f).
(7) An annual calculation of any costs or investment losses or other financial results incurred in compliance with the provisions of this section.
(j) If the board voluntarily sells or transfers all of its investments in a Turkish investment vehicle in accordance with this section, this section shall not apply except that the board shall file a report with the Legislature related to that investment vehicle as described in subdivision (i).
(k) Nothing in this section shall require the board to take action as described in this section if the board determines, and adopts findings, in good faith and based on credible information available to the public, that the action described in this section would fail to satisfy the fiduciary responsibilities of the board as described in Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution.
(l) This section shall be known, and may be cited, as the California Public Divest from Turkey to End the Perpetuation of the Armenian Genocide Act.

The California Constitution provides that the Legislature may by statute prohibit retirement board investments if it is in the public interest to do so, and providing that the prohibition satisfies specified fiduciary standards.
Existing law prohibits the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System from investing public employee retirement funds in a company with active business operations in Sudan and in Iran, as specified.
This bill would additionally prohibit the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the State Teachers’ Retirement System from investing public employee retirement funds in a Turkish investment vehicle, as specified. The bill would require the Board of Administration of the Public Employees’ Retirement System and the Teachers’ Retirement Board of the State Teachers’ Retirement System to sell or transfer any investments in a Turkish investment vehicle.
This bill would require these boards, on or before January 1, 2017, and annually thereafter, to report to the Legislature any investments in a Turkish investment vehicle and the sale or transfer of those investments, subject to the fiduciary duty of these boards.
This bill would indemnify from the General Fund and hold harmless the present, former, and future board members, officers, and employees of and investment managers under contract with those retirement systems.

Existing law, The Student Online Personal Information Protection Act, restricts the use of information about elementary and secondary school students by operators of certain Internet Web sites and online services and applications by, among other things, prohibiting operators from engaging in targeted advertising, amassing student profiles except for K–12 school purposes, or selling or disclosing student information, as specified. Existing law also requires an operator to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the covered information to protect the information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
Existing law also prohibits an operator of an Internet Web site or online service from knowingly using, disclosing, compiling, or allowing a 3rd party to use, disclose, or compile the personal information of a minor for the purpose of marketing or advertising specified types of products or services. Existing law also makes this prohibition applicable to an advertising service that is notified by an operator of an Internet Web site, online service, online application, or mobile application that the site, service, or application is directed to a minor.
This bill would, commencing on July 1, 2017, prohibit the operator of an Internet Web site, online service, online application, or mobile application that is used primarily for preschool or prekindergarten purposes, as defined, and was designed and marketed for preschool and prekindergarten purposes, to knowingly engage in specified activities with respect to their site, service, or application, including, among other things, engaging in targeted advertising, using specified information to amass a profile about a pupil except in furtherance of preschool or prekindergarten purposes, and selling or disclosing a pupil’s information, as specified. The bill would also require an operator to, among other things, implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the information to protect that information from unauthorized access, and to delete a pupil’s information at the request of a preschool, prekindergarten, or district, as specified. The bill would authorize the disclosure of a pupil’s information under specified circumstances. The bill would also provide that its provisions are severable.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares that pilot projects are demonstrating that schools have significantly lower special education costs when schools partner with county-funded Medi-Cal mental health services providers to address the mental health problems of pupils in a comprehensive multitiered model that includes services for pupils at the earliest time, usually years before they would require special education, which can often be prevented. Thus, the Legislature encourages the partnerships authorized by this act to, whenever possible, look for opportunities and funding to provide pupils who do not have individualized education programs, but are in need of, and could benefit from, prevention and early intervention services, with those services. The Legislature further encourages the State Department of Education and the State Department of Health Care Services to work toward the development of protocols to identify students who are Medi-Cal beneficiaries receiving educationally related mental health services as part of an individual educational plan for the purposes of data tracking.

(4) The agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency addresses how to cover the costs of mental health provider services not covered by funds pursuant to paragraph (1) in the event that mental health service costs exceed the agreed-upon funding outlined in the partnership agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency following a yearend cost reconciliation process, and in the event that the local educational agency does not elect to provide the services through other means.
(5) The agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency fulfills reporting and all other requirements under state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1400 et seq.) and Medi-Cal EPSDT provisions, and measures the effect of the mental health intervention and how that intervention meets the goals in a pupil’s IEP or relevant plan for non-IEP pupils.
(6) The county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency participate in the performance outcome system established by the State Department of Health Care Services pursuant to Section 14707.5 to measure results of services provided under the partnership agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency.
(7) A plan to establish a partnership described in this section in at least one school within the local educational agency in the first year and to expand the partnership to three additional schools within three years.
(b) For purposes of this section, “local educational agency” has the same meaning as that term is defined in Section 56026.3 of the Education Code.
(c) Where applicable, and to the extent mutually agreed to by a school district and a plan or insurer, it is the intent of the Legislature that a health care service plan or a health insurer be authorized to participate in the partnerships described in this part.
5921.
(a) The County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund is hereby created in the State Treasury. Moneys in the fund are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the State Department of Education for the purpose of funding the partnerships described in this part.

(2) Other funds identified and appropriated by the Legislature may also be deposited into the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund and used for the purposes specified in subdivision (a).
(c) Funds made available in the annual Budget Act for the purpose of providing educationally related mental health services, including out-of-home residential services for emotionally disturbed pupils, required by an individualized education program, shall be used only for that purpose and shall not be deposited into the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund.

Existing law requires school districts, county offices of education, and special education local plan areas (SELPAs) to comply with state laws that conform to the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, in order that the state may qualify for federal funds available for the education of individuals with exceptional needs. Existing law requires school districts, county offices of education, and SELPAs to identify, locate, and assess individuals with exceptional needs and to provide those pupils with a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment, and with special education and related services, including mental health services, as reflected in an individualized education program.
Existing law contains provisions governing the operation and financing of community mental health services for the mentally disordered in every county through locally administered and locally controlled community mental health programs.
This bill would specifically authorize a county, or a qualified provider operating as part of the county mental health plan network, and a local educational agency to enter into a partnership that includes, among other things, an agreement between the county mental health plan, or the qualified provider, and the local educational agency that establishes a Medi-Cal mental health provider that is county operated or county contracted for the provision of mental health services to pupils of the local educational agency and in which there are provisions for the delivery of campus-based mental health services through qualified providers or qualified professionals to provide on-campus support to identify pupils with a specified education plan and pupils not in special education who a teacher believes may require those services and, with parental consent, to provide mental health services to those pupils. The bill would create the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund in the State Treasury, which would be available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the State Department of Education for the purpose of funding these partnerships, as specified, and would require the State Department of Education to fund these partnerships through a competitive grant program.
The bill would require funds made available in the annual Budget Act for the purpose of providing educationally related mental health services required by an individualized education program to be used only for that purpose and would prohibit those funds from being deposited into the County and Local Educational Agency Partnership Fund.

Section 7522.02 of the Government Code is amended to read:
7522.02.
(a) (1) Notwithstanding any other law, except as provided in this article, on and after January 1, 2013, this article shall apply to all state and local public retirement systems and to their participating employers, including the Public Employees’ Retirement System, the State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Legislators’ Retirement System, the Judges’ Retirement System, the Judges’ Retirement System II, county and district retirement systems created pursuant to the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937 (Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 31450) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 3), independent public retirement systems, and to individual retirement plans offered by public employers. However, this article shall be subject to the Internal Revenue Code and Section 17 of Article XVI of the California Constitution. The administration of the requirements of this article shall comply with applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Revenue and Taxation Code.
(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this article shall not apply to the entities described in Section 9 of Article IX of, and Sections 4 and 5 of Article XI of, the California Constitution, except to the extent that these entities continue to be participating employers in any retirement system governed by state statute. Accordingly, any retirement plan approved before January 1, 2013, by the voters of any entity excluded from coverage by this section shall not be affected by this article.
(3)
(A)
Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this article shall not apply to a public employee whose interests are protected under Section 5333(b) of Title 49 of the United States Code and who became a member of a state or local public retirement system prior to December 30, 2014.
(B) If a federal district court upholds the determination of the United States Secretary of Labor, or his or her designee, that application of this article precludes him or her from providing a certification under Section 5333(b) of Title 49 of the United States Code, this article shall not apply to a public employee whose interests are protected under that section.
(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this article shall not apply to a multiemployer plan authorized by Section 302(c)(5) of the federal Taft-Hartley Act (29 U.S.C. Sec. 186(c)(5)) if the public employer began participation in that plan prior to January 1, 2013, and the plan is regulated by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 et seq.).
(b) The benefit plan required by this article shall apply to public employees who are new members as defined in Section 7522.04.
(c) (1) Individuals who were employed by any public employer before January 1, 2013, and who became employed by a subsequent public employer for the first time on or after January 1, 2013, shall be subject to the retirement plan that would have been available to employees of the subsequent employer who were first employed by the subsequent employer on or before December 31, 2012, if the individual was subject to concurrent membership for which creditable service was performed in the previous six months or reciprocity established under any of the following provisions:
(A) Article 5 (commencing with Section 20350) of Chapter 3 of Part 3 of Division 5 of Title 2.
(B) Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 31450) of Part 3 of Division 4 of Title 3.
(C) Any agreement between public retirement systems to provide reciprocity to members of the systems.

(2) An individual who was employed before January 1, 2013, and who, without a separation from employment, changed employment positions and became subject to a different defined benefit plan in a different public retirement system offered by his or her employer shall be subject to that defined benefit plan as it would have been available to employees who were first employed on or before December 31, 2012.
(d) If a public employer, before January 1, 2013, offers a defined benefit pension plan that provides a defined benefit formula with a lower benefit factor at normal retirement age and results in a lower normal cost than the defined benefit formula required by this article, that employer may continue to offer that defined benefit formula instead of the defined benefit formula required by this article, and shall not be subject to the requirements of Section 7522.10 for pensionable compensation subject to that formula. However, if the employer adopts a new defined benefit formula on or after January 1, 2013, that formula must conform to the requirements of this article or must be determined and certified by the retirement system’s chief actuary and the retirement board to have no greater risk and no greater cost to the employer than the defined benefit formula required by this article and must be approved by the Legislature. New members of the defined benefit plan may only participate in the lower cost defined benefit formula that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a defined benefit formula that conforms to the requirements of this article or is approved by the Legislature as provided in this subdivision.
(e) If a public employer, before January 1, 2013, offers a retirement benefit plan that consists solely of a defined contribution plan, that employer may continue to offer that plan instead of the defined benefit pension plan required by this article. However, if the employer adopts a new defined benefit pension plan or defined benefit formula on or after January 1, 2013, that plan or formula must conform to the requirements of this article or must be determined and certified by the retirement system’s chief actuary and the system’s board to have no greater risk and no greater cost to the employer than the defined benefit formula required by this article and must be approved by the Legislature. New members of the employer’s plan may only participate in the defined contribution plan that was in place before January 1, 2013, or a defined contribution plan or defined benefit formula that conforms to the requirements of this article. This subdivision shall not be construed to prohibit an employer from offering a defined contribution plan on or after January 1, 2013, either with or without a defined benefit plan, whether or not the employer offered a defined contribution plan prior to that date.
(f) (1) If, on or after January 1, 2013, the Cities of Brea and Fullerton form a joint powers authority pursuant to the provisions of the Joint Exercise of Powers Act (Article 1 (commencing with Section 6500) of Chapter 5), that joint powers authority may provide employees the defined benefit plan or formula that those employees received from their respective employers prior to the exercise of a common power, to which the employee is associated, by the joint powers authority to any employee of the City of Brea, the City of Fullerton, or a city described in paragraph (2) who is not a new member and subsequently is employed by the joint powers authority within 180 days of the city providing for the exercise of a common power, to which the employee was associated, by the joint powers authority.
(2) On or before January 1, 2017, a city in Orange County that is contiguous to the City of Brea or the City of Fullerton may join the joint powers authority described in paragraph (1) but not more than three cities shall be permitted to join.
(3) The formation of a joint powers authority on or after January 1, 2013, shall not act in a manner as to exempt a new employee or a new member, as defined by Section 7522.04, from the requirements of this article. New members may only participate in a defined benefit plan or formula that conforms to the requirements of this article.
(g) The Judges’ Retirement System and the Judges’ Retirement System II shall not be required to adopt the defined benefit formula required by Section 7522.20 or 7522.25 or the compensation limitations defined in Section 7522.10.
(h) This article shall not be construed to provide membership in any public retirement system for an individual who would not otherwise be eligible for membership under that system’s applicable rules or laws.
(i) On and after January 1, 2013, each public retirement system shall modify its plan or plans to comply with the requirements of this article and may adopt regulations or resolutions for this purpose.

The California Public Employees’ Pension Reform Act of 2013 (PEPRA) requires a public retirement system, as defined, to modify its plan or plans to comply with the act and, among other provisions, establishes new retirement formulas that may not be exceeded by a public employer offering a defined benefit pension plan for employees first hired on or after January 1, 2013. PEPRA exempts from its provisions certain public employees whose collective bargaining rights are subject to specified provisions of federal law until a specified federal district court decision on a certification by the United States Secretary of Labor, or until January 1, 2016, whichever is sooner.
This bill would extend indefinitely that exemption for those public employees, whose collective bargaining rights are subject to specified provisions of federal law and who became a member of a state or local public retirement system prior to December 30, 2014.
The bill would exempt these employees from PEPRA without regard to date of hire upon issuance of a specified federal district court decision.

(3) If any awards are not distributed pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) upon initial allocation of the awards under this article, the commission shall make awards to as many eligible students as possible, beginning with the students with the lowest expected family contribution and highest academic merit, consistent with the criteria adopted by the commission pursuant to subdivision (c), as practicable without exceeding the applicable annual cumulative total of awards specified in this subdivision.
(c) (1) On or before February 1, 2001, acting pursuant to a public hearing process that is consistent with the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code), the commission shall establish selection criteria for Cal Grant A and B awards under the competitive program that give special consideration to disadvantaged students, taking into consideration those financial, educational, cultural, language, home, community, environmental, and other conditions that hamper a student’s access to, and ability to persist in, postsecondary education programs.
(2) Additional consideration shall be given to both of the following:
(A) Students pursuing Cal Grant B awards who reestablish their grade point averages.
(B) Students who did not receive awards pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 69434), Article 3 (commencing with Section 69435), or Article 4 (commencing with Section 69436).

The commission shall, in this case, hold the award in reserve for the additional year. Upon receipt of a request to transfer the award to a tuition or fee charging qualifying institution, the individual shall be eligible to receive the Cal Grant A award previously held in reserve if, at the time of the request, he or she meets all of the requirements of this article. Upon receipt of the request, the commission shall reassess the financial need of the award recipient. The commission may prescribe the forms and procedures to be used for the purposes of this section. A recipient’s years of eligibility for payment of benefits shall be based upon his or her grade level at the time the award is transferred to the tuition or fee charging qualifying institution. An award so held in reserve shall only be counted once toward the number of awards authorized by subdivision (b) of Section 69437.

(2) The health of the party is such that a preference is necessary to prevent prejudicing the party’s interest in the litigation.
(b) A civil action to recover damages for wrongful death or personal injury shall be entitled to preference upon the motion of any party to the action who is under 14 years of age unless the court finds that the party does not have a substantial interest in the case as a whole.

Existing law provides generally for procedures governing civil actions. Existing law imposes additional procedures that apply with respect to limited types of civil actions.
This bill would enact the Asbestos Tort Claim Trust Transparency Act, which would establish additional procedures with respect to civil actions pertaining to asbestos tort claims, as defined. The bill would, among other things, require, that a plaintiff disclose specified information with respect to any asbestos trusts, as defined, against which the plaintiff has or could pursue a claim, and would entitle a defendant to discover relevant information pertaining to the plaintiff held by other asbestos trusts and to pursue various motions.
This bill would require a plaintiff to serve certain statements made under penalty of perjury. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

(1) Existing law required, on or before July 1, 2014, the governing boards of school districts and county boards of education to adopt a local control and accountability plan using a template adopted by the State Board of Education. Existing law requires the governing board of each school district and each county board of education to update its local control and accountability plan before July 1 of each year. Existing law requires an update to include, among other things, a listing and description of the expenditures for the fiscal year, as specified.
This bill would instead require that the annual update to a school district’s local control and accountability plan include a listing and description of the expenditures at the school district level and by schoolsite for the fiscal year, as specified. The bill would also require that the annual update to a county board of education’s local control and accountability plan include a listing and description of the expenditures at the county level and by schoolsite for the fiscal year, as specified. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

(1)
Existing law requires the governing board of each school district to establish standards of expected pupil achievement at each grade level in each area of study and to evaluate and assess certificated employee performance on a continuing basis as it reasonably relates to the progress of pupils toward the established standards and, if applicable, the state adopted academic content standards as measured by state adopted criterion referenced assessments, the instructional techniques and strategies used by the employee, the employee’s adherence to curricular objectives, and the establishment and maintenance of a suitable learning environment, within the scope of the employee’s responsibilities.
This bill would require the superintendent of a school district and a county superintendent of schools to make available to the public, and post on its Internet Web site, if it has one, specified information relating to the evaluation of teachers and principals. By imposing additional duties on local educational agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(3)
(2)
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 430.41 is added to the Code of Civil Procedure, to read:
430.41.
(a) Before filing a demurrer pursuant to this chapter, the demurring party shall meet and confer in person or by telephone with the party who filed the pleading that is subject to demurrer for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. If an amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer is filed, the responding party shall meet and confer again with the party who filed the amended pleading before filing a demurrer to the amended pleading.
(1) As part of the meet and confer process, the demurring party shall identify all of the specific causes of action that it believes are subject to demurrer and identify with legal support the basis of the deficiencies. The party who filed the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer shall provide legal support for its position that the pleading is legally sufficient or, in the alternative, how the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer could be amended to cure any legal insufficiency.
(2) The parties shall meet and confer at least five days before the date the responsive pleading is due. If the parties are not able to meet and confer at least five days prior to the date the responsive pleading is due, the demurring party shall be granted an automatic 30-day extension of time within which to file a responsive pleading, by filing and serving, on or before the date on which a demurrer would be due, a declaration stating under penalty of perjury that a good faith attempt to meet and confer was made and explaining the reasons why the parties could not meet and confer. The 30-day extension shall commence from the date the responsive pleading was previously due, and the demurring party shall not be subject to default during the period of the extension. Any further extensions shall be obtained by court order upon a showing of good cause.
(3) The demurring party shall file and serve with the demurrer a declaration stating either of the following:
(A) The means by which the demurring party met and conferred with the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer, and that the parties did not reach an agreement resolving the objections raised in the demurrer.
(B) That the party who filed the pleading subject to demurrer failed to respond to the meet and confer request of the demurring party or otherwise failed to meet and confer in good faith.
(4) Any determination by the court that the meet and confer process was insufficient shall not be grounds to overrule or sustain a demurrer.
(b) A party demurring to a pleading that has been amended after a demurrer to an earlier version of the pleading was sustained shall not demur to any portion of the amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer on grounds that could have been raised by demurrer to the earlier version of the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer.
(c) If a court sustains a demurrer to one or more causes of action and grants leave to amend, the court may order a conference of the parties before an amended complaint or cross-complaint or a demurrer to an amended complaint or cross-complaint, may be filed. If a conference is held, the court shall not preclude a party from filing a demurrer and the time to file a demurrer shall not begin until after the conference has concluded. Nothing in this section prohibits the court from ordering a conference on its own motion at any time or prevents a party from requesting that the court order a conference to be held.
(d) This section does not apply to the following civil actions:
(1) An action in which a party not represented by counsel is incarcerated in a local, state, or federal correctional institution.
(2) A proceeding in forcible entry, forcible detainer, or unlawful detainer.
(e) (1) In response to a demurrer and prior to the case being at issue, a complaint or cross-complaint shall not be amended more than three times, absent an offer to the trial court as to such additional facts to be pleaded that there is a reasonable possibility the defect can be cured to state a cause of action. The three-amendment limit shall not include an amendment made without leave of the court pursuant to Section 472, provided the amendment is made before a demurrer to the original complaint or cross-complaint is filed.
(2) Nothing in this section affects the rights of a party to amend its pleading or respond to an amended pleading after the case is at issue.
(f) Nothing in this section affects appellate review or the rights of a party pursuant to Section 430.80.
(g) If a demurrer is overruled as to a cause of action and that cause of action is not further amended, the demurring party preserves its right to appeal after final judgment without filing a further demurrer.
(h) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 2.
Section 472 of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to read:
472.
(a) A party may amend its pleading once without leave of the court at any time before the answer or demurrer is filed, or after a demurrer is filed but before the demurrer is heard if the amended complaint, cross-complaint, or answer is filed and served no later than the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer. A party may amend the complaint, cross-complaint, or answer after the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer, upon stipulation by the parties. The time for responding to an amended pleading shall be computed from the date of service of the amended pleading.
(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2021, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2021, deletes or extends that date.

(b) This section shall become operative on January 1, 2021.
SEC. 4.
Section 472a of the Code of Civil Procedure is amended to read:
472a.

(b) Except as otherwise provided by rule adopted by the Judicial Council, if a demurrer to a complaint or to a cross-complaint is overruled and there is no answer filed, the court shall allow an answer to be filed upon such terms as may be just. If a demurrer to the answer is overruled, the action shall proceed as if no demurrer had been interposed, and the facts alleged in the answer shall be considered as denied to the extent mentioned in Section 431.20.
(c) Subject to the limitations imposed by subdivision (e) of Section 430.41, if a demurrer is sustained, the court may grant leave to amend the pleading upon any terms as may be just and shall fix the time within which the amendment or amended pleading shall be filed. If a demurrer is stricken pursuant to Section 436 and there is no answer filed, the court shall allow an answer to be filed on terms that are just.
(d) If a motion to strike is granted pursuant to Section 436, the court may order that an amendment or amended pleading be filed upon terms it deems proper. If a motion to strike a complaint or cross-complaint, or portion thereof, is denied, the court shall allow the party filing the motion to strike to file an answer.
(e) If a motion to dismiss an action pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 583.210) of Chapter 1.5 of Title 8 is denied, the court shall allow a pleading to be filed.

(e) If a motion to dismiss an action pursuant to Article 2 (commencing with Section 583.210) of Chapter 1.5 of Title 8 is denied, the court shall allow a pleading to be filed.
(f) This section shall become operative on January 1, 2021.

Under existing law, a party in a civil action may object to a complaint, cross-complaint, or answer by demurrer, as specified. Existing law authorizes a party to amend a pleading once without leave of the court at any time before an answer or demurrer is filed, or after a demurrer is filed and before the trial of the issue of law thereon.
This bill would require a demurring party in certain civil actions, before filing the demurrer, to engage in a specified meet and confer process with the party who filed the pleading demurred to for the purpose of determining whether an agreement can be reached as to the filing of an amended pleading that would resolve the objections to be raised in the demurrer. The bill would prohibit a party from amending a complaint or cross-complaint more than 3 times in response to a demurrer filed before the case is at issue, except as specified. The bill would prohibit a party from demurring to a pleading that is amended following a sustained demurrer as to any portion of the amended pleading on grounds that could have been raised by the prior demurrer.
This bill would also authorize a party to amend a pleading after a demurrer is filed but before it is heard by the court if the amended pleading is filed and served before the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer. The bill would authorize a party to amend a pleading after the date for filing an opposition to the demurrer upon stipulation by the parties.
The bill would repeal its provisions on January 1, 2021.
The bill would require a demurring party, in some circumstances, to file a declaration under penalty of perjury. By expanding the scope of the crime of perjury, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

(1) Existing law requires the State Air Resources Board to adopt and implement standards for the control of emissions from new motor vehicles that the state board finds to be necessary and technologically feasible. Existing law prohibits a new motor vehicle from being sold in the state that does not meet the emissions standards adopted by the state board. Existing law provides that a person who violates specified vehicular air pollution statutes or specified orders, rules, or regulations of the state board is subject to a civil penalty of up to $500 per vehicle. Existing law provides that any manufacturer who sells, attempts to sell, or causes to be offered for sale a new motor vehicle that fails to meet the applicable emission standards is subject to a civil penalty of $5,000 per violation. Existing law provides that a manufacturer or distributor who does not comply with the emission standards or the test procedures adopted by the state board is subject to a civil penalty of $50 per vehicle.
This bill would increase those penalties to up to $37,500 per violation. The bill would require the state board to adjust those maximum penalties for inflation, as specified, and would exempt those adjustments from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would authorize the state board to require the payment of a penalty for the violation of specified vehicular air pollution statutes or specified orders, rules, or regulations of the state board, and making the products compliant with specified laws, as conditions for the continued sale of those products.
This bill would authorize the state board to order a manufacturer of motor vehicles to bring the vehicles into compliance with the emissions configuration to which they were certified. The bill would authorize the state board to require the manufacturer to be in compliance with the state board’s order as a condition for the continued sale of motor vehicles in the state.
(2) Existing law prohibits a person who is a state resident or who operates an established place of business within the state from importing, delivering, purchasing, renting, leasing, acquiring, or receiving a new motor vehicle, new motor vehicle engine, or motor vehicle with a new motor vehicle engine for use, registration, or resale in the state unless the motor vehicle engine or new motor vehicle has been certified to meet specified emissions standards. Existing law provides that a person who violates specified provisions relating to transactions of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines is subject to a civil penalty of up to $5,000 per vehicle.
This bill instead would prohibit any person from offering for sale, introducing into commerce, importing, delivering, purchasing, renting, leasing, acquiring, or receiving a new motor vehicle, new motor vehicle engine, or motor vehicle with a new motor vehicle engine for use, registration, or resale in the state unless the motor vehicle engine or new motor vehicle has been certified to meet those specified emissions standards.
This bill would increase the civil penalty to up to $37,500 per violation and up to $10,000 for a dealer, as defined, for violating those specified provisions relating to transactions of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines. The bill would require the state board to adjust those maximum penalties for inflation, as specified, and would exempt those adjustments from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would authorize the state board to require the payment of the penalty, and making the motor vehicles compliant with specified laws, as conditions for the continued or further sale in the state of those motor vehicles.
This bill would require the state board to limit to $5,000 a specified civil penalty imposed on a manufacturer who does not meet the requirements of specified regulations that require manufacturers to have a specified percentage of their new motor vehicle sales be zero-emission vehicles.

The California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973 provides the Division of Occupational Safety and Health within the Department of Industrial Relations with the power, jurisdiction, and supervision over all employment and places of employment necessary to enforce and administer all occupational health and safety laws and to protect employees. The Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board, an independent entity within the department, has the exclusive authority to adopt occupational safety and health standards within the state.
This bill would require the board, by June 1, 2017, to adopt a standard that requires an employer performing corrosion prevention work on industrial and infrastructure projects to use trained and certified personnel, as specified. Because certain violations of these new requirements would be a misdemeanor, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
Existing law provides for apprenticeship programs within the Division of Apprenticeship Standards within the Department of Industrial Relations, sponsored by specific entities and employers, and requires the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards to perform various functions with respect to apprenticeship programs and the welfare of apprentices.
Existing law also establishes the California Apprenticeship Council within the Division of Apprenticeship Standards, and requires the council to aid the director in formulating policies with respect to apprentice regulation.
Existing law requires the Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards and the California Apprenticeship Council to report annually through the Director of Industrial Relations on the activities of the division and the council, and further requires that the report include specified information with respect to apprenticeship programs in this state.
This bill would require the report to include an analysis of any apprenticeship standards or regulations that were proposed or adopted in the previous year.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The State of California has long recognized the mental health needs of California’s children and the value of addressing these needs by supporting the provision of evidence-based mental health services in publicly funded preschools and elementary schools, as evidenced by the creation in 1981 of the Primary Prevention Project, now named the Primary Intervention Program, and the creation in 1991 of the School-based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services for Children Program, known as the Early Mental Health Initiative (EMHI).
(b) From the 1992–93 fiscal year to the 2011–12 fiscal year, the State Department of Mental Health awarded funds each year in matching grants to local education agencies to fund prevention and early intervention programs, including the Primary Intervention Program, for students experiencing mild to moderate school adjustment difficulty through the EMHI. In the 2011–12 fiscal year, the EMHI received $15 million in state funds.
(c) Authorizing legislation specified that the EMHI would be deemed successful if at least 75 percent of the children who complete the program show an improvement in at least one of the following four areas: learning behaviors, attendance, school adjustment, and school-related competencies.
(d) The EMHI succeeded in meeting these legislative requirements. According to the 2010/2011 Early Mental Health Initiative Statewide Evaluation Report, of the 15,823 students located in 424 elementary schools across 66 school districts participating in EMHI-funded services during the 2010–11 school year, 79 percent exhibited positive social competence and school adjustment behaviors more frequently after completing services. Furthermore, the magnitude of the improvements was exceptional in comparison to evaluations of other programs, especially given the short-term and cost-effective nature of the intervention.
(e) The 2010/2011 Early Mental Health Initiative Statewide Evaluation Report described an unmet demand for EMHI-funded services at participating schoolsites, as only 37 percent of the students that scored in the mild to moderate school adjustment difficulty range were served with EMHI-funded services due to program capacity and funding constraints. Based on demographic considerations, similar demand would be expected at schools that did not receive EMHI grants.
(f) The Governor’s realignment for the 2011–12 fiscal year renamed the State Department of Mental Health as the State Department of State Hospitals and limited that department’s mission.
(g) The Budget Act of 2012 disbursed Proposition 98 funds, which had been used to fund the EMHI, directly to local education agencies in order to provide local schools with enhanced flexibility to manage their finances and give greater control of local decisions.
(h) It is in the interest of California’s children, families, schools, and communities that the State of California support local decisions to provide funding for evidence-based services to address the mental health needs of children in publicly funded preschools and elementary schools.
(i) Multitiered systems and supports have been developed as model framework within which to implement these services. Pilot programs in the Counties of San Bernardino and Alameda are demonstrating that implementing these services as part of a multitiered system is cost effective, because the cost of the services is more than fully offset by the reduction in the need for high-cost nonpublic school placements.
SEC. 2.
Section 4372 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to read:
4372.
For the purposes of this part, the following definitions shall apply:

In working with these selected schoolsites, the department shall develop methods and standards for providing services and practices to new schoolsites.
(2) During the subsequent 18 months of the program, the department shall select 30 new schoolsites that are not providing eligible support services but that demonstrate the willingness and capacity to participate in the program. The department shall work with these schoolsites to deliver eligible support services.
(3) In selecting schoolsites and providing support, the department shall prioritize geographic diversity, program effectiveness, program efficiency, and long-term program sustainability.
(f) The department shall submit, in compliance with Section 9795 of the Government Code, an interim report to the Legislature at the end of the second year of the pilot program that details the department’s work to support the schoolsites selected pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) and includes an assessment of the demand and impact of funding for the School-Based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services Matching Grant Program established pursuant to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 4390).

Existing law, the School-based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services for Children Act of 1991, authorizes the Director of Health Care Services, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Instruction, to provide matching grants to local educational agencies to pay the state share of the costs of providing school-based early mental health intervention and prevention services to eligible pupils at schoolsites of eligible pupils, subject to the availability of funding each year. Existing law defines “eligible pupil” for this purpose as a pupil who attends a publicly funded elementary school and who is in kindergarten or grades 1 to 3, inclusive. Existing law also defines “local educational agency” as a school district or county office of education or a state special school.
This bill would expand the definition of an eligible pupil to include a pupil who attends a state preschool program at a publicly funded elementary school and a pupil who is in transitional kindergarten, thereby extending the application of the act to those persons. The bill would also include charter schools in the definition of local educational agency, thereby extending the application of the act to those entities. The bill would require the State Public Health Officer, in consultation with the Superintendent of Public Schools and the Director of Health Care Services, to establish a 4-year pilot program, the School-Based Early Mental Health Intervention and Prevention Services Support Program, to provide outreach, free regional training, and technical assistance for local educational agencies in providing mental health services at schoolsites. The bill would require the State Department of Public Health to submit specified reports after 2 and 4 years. The bill would repeal these provisions as of January 1, 2021.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 3217 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
3217.
(a) (1) The supervisor shall continue the prohibition against Southern California Gas Company injecting any natural gas into the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility located in the County of Los Angeles until a comprehensive review of the safety of the gas storage wells at the facility is completed and the supervisor determines that well integrity has been ensured by the review, the risks of failures identified in the review have been addressed, and the supervisor’s duty to prevent damage to life, health, property, and natural resources, and other requirements, as specified in Section 3106, is satisfied. The supervisor may not lift the prohibition on injection until the Executive Director of the Public Utilities Commission has concurred via letter with the supervisor regarding his or her determination of safety.
(2) For purposes of this section, “facility” means the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility located in the County of Los Angeles operated by Southern California Gas Company.
(b) (1) The criteria for the gas storage well comprehensive safety review shall be determined by the supervisor with input from contracted independent experts and shall include the steps in subdivision (c).
(2) The supervisor shall direct the contracted independent experts to provide a methodology to be used in assessing the tests and inspections specified in the criteria. This requirement may be satisfied by the independent experts reviewing and, if necessary, revising the division’s written methodology for assessing the tests and inspections specified in the criteria. The methodology shall include all tests and inspections required by the criteria. The division shall post the methodology online on a public portion of its Internet Web site.
(c) The gas storage well comprehensive safety review shall include the following steps to ensure external and internal well mechanical integrity:
(1) All gas storage wells shall be tested and inspected from the surface to the packer or to any wellbore restriction near the top of the geologic formation being used for gas storage, whichever is higher in elevation, to detect existing leaks using temperature and noise logs.
(2) Any leaks shall be stopped and remediated to the satisfaction of the supervisor.
(3) Following remediation, leak detection tests shall be repeated and results reviewed by the supervisor.
(4) (A) Unless a well has been fully plugged and abandoned to the supervisor’s satisfaction and in accordance with Section 3208, the well shall be evaluated and remediated in accordance with subparagraph (B) or plugged in accordance with subparagraph (C).
(B) If a gas storage well is intended to return to service for the purposes of resuming injections to the facility, it shall be tested and inspected from the surface to the packer or to any wellbore restriction near the top of the geologic formation being used for gas storage, whichever is higher in elevation, to ensure mechanical integrity. As identified in the division’s criteria, these tests and inspections shall include the measurement of casing thickness and integrity, an evaluation of the cement bond on the casing, the determination as to whether any deformities in the well casing exist, and an evaluation of the well’s ability to withstand pressures that exceed maximum allowable injection and production pressures, with a reasonable margin for safety, at the facility in accordance with the criteria determined by the supervisor with input from independent experts pursuant to subdivision (b). If the tests reveal that a well poses a risk of failure, the supervisor shall require remediation and repeat tests as necessary to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the supervisor that remediation has mitigated any potential identified risks. If the operator cannot remediate the well to mitigate the identified risks to the satisfaction of the supervisor, the well shall be plugged and abandoned in accordance with Section 3208.
(C) (i) If a well is to be taken out of service before resumption of gas injections at the facility, it shall be removed from operation and isolated from the gas storage reservoir through plugging according to the division’s criteria, including, but not limited to, the demonstration of sufficient cement to prevent migrations between the reservoir and other zones, placement of a mechanical plug at the bottom of the well, and subsequent filling of the well with fluid, and to specifications approved by the supervisor. All gas storage wells that are taken out of service under this subparagraph shall be subjected to ongoing testing and monitoring requirements identified in the criteria determined by the supervisor with input from independent experts. The monitoring shall include, but not be limited to, real-time and daily pressure monitoring, as applicable. A gas storage well shall not be returned to service unless the testing and remediation required under subparagraph (B) has been completed.
(ii) A gas storage well, within one year of being plugged and isolated from the gas storage reservoir pursuant to clause (i), shall either be returned to service by satisfactorily completing the testing and remediation required under subparagraph (B) or be permanently plugged and abandoned to the supervisor’s satisfaction in accordance with Section 3208.
(D) The supervisor shall make a written finding for each gas storage well that has satisfactorily completed the testing and remediation required under subparagraph (B).
(5) The gas storage well comprehensive safety review is not complete until every gas storage well at the facility has completed the testing and remediation required under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4), been temporarily abandoned and isolated from the reservoir as required under clause (i) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (4), or been fully plugged and abandoned to the supervisor’s satisfaction in accordance with Section 3208.
(d) Upon completion of the gas storage well comprehensive safety review but before authorizing the commencement of injections at the facility, the division shall hold at least one duly noticed public meeting in the affected community to provide the public an opportunity to comment on the safety review findings and on the proposed pressure limit as provided in subdivision (e).
(e) (1) Before commencing injections at the facility, the operator of the facility shall provide the division with the proposed maximum reservoir pressure and include data and calculations supporting the basis for the pressure limit. The pressure limit shall account for the pressure required to inject intended gas volumes at all proposed inventory levels and the pressure limit shall not exceed the design pressure limits of the reservoir, wells, wellheads, piping, or associated facilities with an appropriate margin for safety.
(2) The operator’s proposed maximum reservoir pressure shall be subject to review and approval by the supervisor, and the supervisor shall consult with independent experts regarding the appropriate maximum and minimum reservoir pressure at the facility.
(f) Once the gas storage well comprehensive safety review is complete pursuant to paragraph (5) of subdivision (c), the supervisor has approved the maximum and minimum reservoir pressure pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (e), and the public hearing is held pursuant to subdivision (d), the supervisor may allow injections of natural gas at the facility.
(g) All gas storage wells returning to service pursuant to subdivision (f) shall only inject or produce gas through the interior metal tubing and not through the annulus between the tubing and the well casing. The operator shall also conduct ongoing pressure monitoring and comply with any other requirements specified by the supervisor.
(h) The gas storage wells at the facility that are plugged and abandoned in accordance with Section 3208 pursuant to this section shall be periodically inspected by the operator for leaks using effective gas leak detection techniques such as optical gas imaging.
(i) (1) Before the completion of the gas storage well comprehensive safety review, production of natural gas from gas storage wells at the facility shall be limited to gas storage wells that have satisfactorily completed the testing and remediation required under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (c) unless insufficient production capacity is available. Only if production capacity supplied by the tested and remediated wells is demonstrably insufficient may the supervisor allow other gas storage wells to be used.
(2) The supervisor shall direct the operator of the facility to provide a plan to ensure, at the earliest possible time, the availability of sufficient gas production capacity using gas storage wells that have satisfactorily completed the testing and remediation required under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (c).
(j) With respect to the gas storage well comprehensive safety review at the facility, all testing, inspection and monitoring results reported to the division, gas storage well compliance status, any required remediation steps, and other safety review-related materials shall be posted in a timely manner by the division online on a public portion of its Internet Web site.

(1) Under existing law, the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources in the Department of Conservation regulates the drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of oil and gas wells in the state. Existing law requires the State Oil and Gas Supervisor to supervise the drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of wells and the operation, maintenance, and removal or abandonment of tanks and facilities related to oil and gas production within an oil and gas field, so as to prevent damage to life, health, property, and natural resources, as provided; to permit owners and operators of wells to utilize all known methods and practices to increase the ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons; and to perform the supervisor’s duties in a manner that encourages the wise development of oil and gas resources to best meet oil and gas needs in this state. Under existing law, a person who fails to comply with certain requirements relating to the regulation of oil or gas operations is guilty of a misdemeanor.
This bill would require the supervisor to continue the prohibition against Southern California Gas Company injecting any natural gas into the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility located in the County of Los Angeles until a comprehensive review of the safety of the gas storage wells at the facility is completed, as specified, the supervisor determines that well integrity has been ensured by the review, the risks of failures identified in the review have been addressed, the supervisor’s duty to prevent damage to life, health, property, and natural resources, and other requirements is satisfied, and the Executive Director of the Public Utilities Commission has concurred via letter with the supervisor regarding his or her determination of safety. The bill would require the supervisor to determine criteria for the gas storage well comprehensive safety review with input from independent experts and would require the criteria to include, but not be limited to, specified tests and inspections. The bill would require the supervisor to direct the contracted independent experts to provide a methodology to be used in assessing the tests and inspections specified in the criteria. The bill would require the division to post the methodology on a public portion of its Internet Web site. The bill would require the operator of the facility to provide the division with the proposed maximum reservoir pressure and to include data and calculations supporting the basis for the pressure limit. The bill would authorize the supervisor to allow injections of natural gas into the facility once the gas storage well comprehensive safety review is complete, the division holds a duly noticed public hearing in the affected community to provide the public an opportunity to comment on the safety review findings and the proposed pressure limit, and the supervisor has approved the maximum and minimum reservoir pressure at the facility. The bill would also require that, before the completion of the gas storage well comprehensive safety review, the production of natural gas from gas storage wells at the facility be limited to gas storage wells that have satisfactorily completed the testing and remediation required under the review, except as specified. The bill would require the supervisor to direct the operator of the facility to provide a plan to ensure, at the earliest possible time, the availability of sufficient gas production capacity using gas storage wells that have satisfactorily completed the testing and remediation required under the review. The bill would require all gas storage wells returning to service under these provisions to inject or produce gas only through the interior metal tubing, and would require the operator to conduct ongoing pressure monitoring and comply with any other requirements specified by the supervisor. The bill would require the gas storage wells at the facility that are plugged and abandoned pursuant to these provisions to be periodically inspected by the operator for leaks using effective gas leak detection techniques. The bill would require the division, with respect to the review and in a timely manner, to post all testing, inspection and monitoring results, and other safety review-related materials to a public portion of the division’s Internet Web site. Because a violation of certain of these requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2021.
(2) Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission is authorized to supervise and regulate every public utility in the state. Under existing law, a violation of the Public Utilities Act or any order, decision, rule, direction, demand, or requirement of the commission is a crime.
This bill would require the commission, no later than July 1, 2017, to open a proceeding to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility located in the County of Los Angeles while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, and to consult with specified entities in making its determination. The bill would require the commission, in consultation with specified entities, to determine the range of working gas necessary to ensure safety and reliability for the region and just and reasonable rates in California, and to direct the operator of the facility to provide all information the commission deems necessary to make that determination. The bill would require the commission, within 30 days of the effective date of this act, to publish a report, including specified information regarquired by this act for a specified reason.
(4) This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 1347 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1347.
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to provide the court with discretion to employ alternative court procedures to protect the rights of a child witness, the rights of the defendant, and the integrity of the judicial process. In exercising its discretion, the court necessarily will be required to balance the rights of the defendant or defendants against the need to protect a child witness and to preserve the integrity of the court’s truthfinding function. This discretion is intended to be used selectively when the facts and circumstances in an individual case present compelling evidence of the need to use these alternative procedures.
(b) Notwithstanding any other law, the court in a criminal proceeding, upon written notice by the prosecutor made at least three days prior to the date of the preliminary hearing or trial date on which the testimony of the minor is scheduled, or during the course of the proceeding on the court’s own motion, may order that the testimony of a minor 13 years of age or younger at the time of the motion be taken by contemporaneous examination and cross-examination in another place and out of the presence of the judge, jury, defendant or defendants, and attorneys, and communicated to the courtroom by means of closed-circuit television, if the court makes all of the following findings:
(1) The minor’s testimony will involve a recitation of the facts of any of the following:
(A) An alleged sexual offense committed on or with the minor.
(B) An alleged violent felony, as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5.
(C) An alleged felony offense specified in Section 273a or 273d of which the minor is a victim.
(2) The impact on the minor of one or more of the factors enumerated in subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive, is shown by clear and convincing evidence to be so substantial as to make the minor unavailable as a witness unless closed-circuit testimony is used.
(A) Testimony by the minor in the presence of the defendant would result in the child suffering serious emotional distress so that the child would be unavailable as a witness.
(B) The defendant used a deadly weapon in the commission of the offense.
(C) The defendant threatened serious bodily injury to the child or the child’s family, threatened incarceration or deportation of the child or a member of the child’s family, threatened removal of the child from the child’s family, or threatened the dissolution of the child’s family in order to prevent or dissuade the minor from attending or giving testimony at any trial or court proceeding, or to prevent the minor from reporting the alleged sexual offense, or from assisting in criminal prosecution.
(D) The defendant inflicted great bodily injury upon the child in the commission of the offense.
(E) The defendant or his or her counsel behaved during the hearing or trial in a way that caused the minor to be unable to continue his or her testimony.
In making the determination required by this section, the court shall consider the age of the minor, the relationship between the minor and the defendant or defendants, any handicap or disability of the minor, and the nature of the acts charged. The minor’s refusal to testify shall not alone constitute sufficient evidence that the special procedure described in this section is necessary to obtain the minor’s testimony.
(3) The equipment available for use of closed-circuit television would accurately communicate the image and demeanor of the minor to the judge, jury, defendant or defendants, and attorneys.
(c) If the court orders the use of closed-circuit television, two-way closed-circuit television shall be used, except that if the impact on the minor of one or more of the factors enumerated in subparagraphs (A) to (E), inclusive, of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), is shown by clear and convincing evidence to be so substantial as to make the minor unavailable as a witness even if two-way closed-circuit television is used, one-way closed-circuit television may be used. The prosecution shall give the defendant or defendants at least 30 days’ written notice of the prosecution’s intent to seek the use of one-way closed-circuit television, unless the prosecution shows good cause to the court why this 30-day notice requirement should not apply.
(d) (1) The hearing on a motion brought pursuant to this section shall be conducted out of the presence of the jury.
(2) Notwithstanding Section 804 of the Evidence Code or any other law, the court, in determining the merits of the motion, shall not compel the minor to testify at the hearing, nor shall the court deny the motion on the ground that the minor has not testified.
(3) In determining whether the impact on an individual child of one or more of the five factors enumerated in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) is so substantial that the minor is unavailable as a witness unless two-way or one-way closed-circuit television is used, the court may question the minor in chambers, or at some other comfortable place other than the courtroom, on the record for a reasonable period of time with the support person, the prosecutor, and defense counsel present. The defendant or defendants shall not be present. The court shall conduct the questioning of the minor and shall not permit the prosecutor or defense counsel to examine the minor. The prosecutor and defense counsel shall be permitted to submit proposed questions to the court prior to the session in chambers. Defense counsel shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with the defendant or defendants prior to the conclusion of the session in chambers.
(e) When the court orders the testimony of a minor to be taken in another place outside of the courtroom, the court shall do all of the following:
(1) Make a brief statement on the record, outside of the presence of the jury, of the reasons in support of its order. While the statement need not include traditional findings of fact, the reasons shall be set forth with sufficient specificity to permit meaningful review and to demonstrate that discretion was exercised in a careful, reasonable, and equitable manner.
(2) Instruct the members of the jury that they are to draw no inferences from the use of closed-circuit television as a means of facilitating the testimony of the minor.
(3) Instruct respective counsel, outside of the presence of the jury, that they are to make no comment during the course of the trial on the use of closed-circuit television procedures.
(4) Instruct the support witness, outside of the presence of the jury, that he or she is not to coach, cue, or in any way influence or attempt to influence the testimony of the minor.
(5) Order that a complete record of the examination of the minor, including the images and voices of all persons who in any way participate in the examination, be made and preserved as a video recording in addition to being stenographically recorded. The video recording shall be transmitted to the clerk of the court in which the action is pending and shall be made available for viewing to the prosecuting attorney, the defendant or defendants, and his or her attorney during ordinary business hours. The video recording shall be destroyed after five years have elapsed from the date of entry of judgment. If an appeal is filed, the video recording shall not be destroyed until a final judgment on appeal has been ordered. A video recording that is taken pursuant to this section is subject to a protective order of the court for the purpose of protecting the privacy of the witness. This subdivision does not affect the provisions of subdivision (b) of Section 868.7.
(f) When the court orders the testimony of a minor to be taken in another place outside the courtroom, only the minor, a support person designated pursuant to Section 868.5, a nonuniformed bailiff, any technicians necessary to operate the closed-circuit equipment, and, after consultation with the prosecution and the defense, a representative appointed by the court, shall be physically present for the testimony. A video recording device shall record the image of the minor and his or her testimony, and a separate video recording device shall record the image of the support person.
(g) When the court orders the testimony of a minor to be taken in another place outside the courtroom, the minor shall be brought into the judge’s chambers prior to the taking of his or her testimony to meet for a reasonable period of time with the judge, the prosecutor, and defense counsel. A support person for the minor shall also be present. This meeting shall be for the purpose of explaining the court process to the child and to allow the attorneys an opportunity to establish rapport with the child to facilitate later questioning by closed-circuit television. No participant shall discuss the defendant or defendants or any of the facts of the case with the minor during this meeting.
(h) When the court orders the testimony of a minor to be taken in another place outside the courtroom, nothing in this section prohibits the court from ordering the minor to be brought into the courtroom for a limited purpose, including the identification of the defendant or defendants as the court deems necessary.
(i) The examination shall be under oath, and the defendant or defendants shall be able to see and hear the minor witness, and if two-way closed-circuit television is used, the defendant’s image shall be transmitted live to the witness.
(j) Nothing in this section affects the disqualification of witnesses pursuant to Section 701 of the Evidence Code.
(k) The cost of examination by contemporaneous closed-circuit television ordered pursuant to this section shall be borne by the court out of its existing budget.
(l) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a defendant from being represented by counsel during any closed-circuit testimony.

Existing law authorizes a court in a criminal proceeding, upon written notice by the prosecutor made at least 3 days prior to the date of the preliminary hearing or trial date on which the testimony of the minor is scheduled or during the course of the proceeding on the court’s own motion, to order that the testimony of a minor 13 years of age or younger at the time of the motion be taken by contemporaneous examination and cross-examination in another place and out of the presence of the judge, jury, defendant or defendants, and attorneys, and communicated to the courtroom by means of closed-circuit television, if the court makes specified findings. One of the findings existing law requires is that the minor’s testimony will involve a recitation of the facts of specified crimes, including an alleged violent felony of which the minor is a victim.
This bill would authorize a minor 13 years of age or younger to testify by contemporaneous examination and cross-examination if the testimony will involve the recitation of the facts of an alleged violent felony, whether or not the minor is a victim.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The issue of corruption in small charter cities across the state is an increasing and alarming trend, with no signs of slowing or stopping.
(b) Small charter cities such as the City of Vernon, the City of Bell, and the City of Industry have long histories of abuses of power within city limits, going back decades. Those abuses include inflated salaries for city officials, failing to establish minimum qualifications for key positions, fiscally risky bond issuances, misappropriation of public funds, city officials issuing loans to themselves, failure to plan basic municipal responsibilities such as energy purchases according to best practices, incorrectly classifying employees to obtain higher, unearned retirement benefits, forcing employees to work at will for the city council, buying residential properties and renting them at below-market rents to city workers, inadequate and self-serving contracting policies, routine violations of conflict-of-interest policies, and little or no restrictions on city-issued credit cards.
(c) The voter base in small charter cities is tightly managed by city officials. The housing units within these cities are controlled by city leaders and rented out to handpicked tenants at below-market cost, thus keeping the voter base indebted to those in power. Efforts to broaden the homeowning population have met with resistance from city leaders, with officials in one city cutting power to new residents in an effort to force them from their homes.
(d) Criminal charges have also been filed in some instances, furthering the notion that these cities should not govern themselves. Voter fraud, conspiracy, and misappropriation of public funds are some of the charges that have been investigated, and are still being investigated, in some cases.
(e) This corruption has taken a toll on voter trust, citizen confidence, and taxpayer funds.
(f) In January 2016, an audit was released by the Controller highlighting the lack of administrative and internal accounting controls. Out of the 79 control elements evaluated by the Controller, 85 percent was found to be inadequate. Of the ethical components evaluated, none were found to be adequate.
(g) Historically, cities with small population size were not authorized to adopt a charter for local governance. However, in 1970, the Constitution was amended to authorize any city to adopt a charter. Since then, California’s citizens have seen one after another small charter city become mired in corruption and the leaders of these cities enrich themselves at the expense of the California taxpayer. Ensuring that our citizens, no matter where they live, have an open, honest, and transparent government is a matter of statewide concern, and not a municipal affair, and as a result the Legislature has the authority and the responsibility to impose heightened governing requirements. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that the provisions of this act are not a municipal affair, as that term is used in Section 5 of Article XI of the California Constitution, but are instead a matter of statewide concern.
SEC. 2.
Section 34096 is added to the Government Code, to read:
34096.
Notwithstanding any other law, all of the following shall apply to a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992:
(a) No more than 5 percent of the city’s total city-owned housing may be occupied by any of the following persons:
(1) Employees or officers of the city, including the family of employees or officers of the city.
(2) Persons that contract with the city, including employees of persons or companies that contract with the city, and including the family of persons who contract with the city and the family of employees of persons or companies that contract with the city.
(b) The city shall make an annual disclosure of all property owned by the city, wherever that property is situated.
(c) The city shall conduct an annual audit that utilizes internal control components and elements based on the guidelines established by the Government Accountability Office’s Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool. The city shall substantially comply with those guidelines.
(d) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2028, and as of that date is repealed.
SEC. 3.
Section 36516.7 is added to the Government Code, to read:
36516.7.
(a) Notwithstanding any other law, the compensation for service on the city council of a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992, shall not exceed $1,000 per month.
(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2028, and as of that date is repealed.
SEC. 4.
Section 1100.8 is added to the Public Contract Code, to read:
1100.8.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 1100.7, this code shall apply to contracts entered into by a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992, including, but not limited to, contracts for the provision of waste collection and management services.
(b) This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2028, and as of that date is repealed.
SEC.
5.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the concerns related to the governance of a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992.
SEC. 6.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.
SECTION 1.
Section 34450 of the
Government Code
is amended to read:
34450.
Any city or city and county may enact, amend, or repeal a charter for its own government pursuant to this article or Article 3 (commencing with Section 9255) of Chapter 3 of Division 9 of the Elections Code.

Existing law
The California Constitution
authorizes any city or city and county to enact, amend, or repeal a charter for its own government, as specified.
A charter adopted pursuant to these provisions supersedes general laws of the state in regard to a municipal affair, and a city charter may specify various matters including, but not limited to, compensation of city
employees.
This bill would, until January 1, 2028, require a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992, to conduct audits pursuant to a specified procedure and provide annual disclosures of property owned by the city, as specified. By increasing the duties of local officials, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill would, until January 1, 2028, additionally prohibit a city meeting this description from permitting more than 5% of any cityowned housing to be occupied by a city employee or officer, or person who contracts with the city, or their family. The bill would provide that until January 1, 2028, the compensation for service on the city council of a city meeting this description may not exceed $1,000 per month.
Existing law states that the Public Contract Code is the basis of all contracts between most public entities and their contractors and subcontractors. Existing law further states that, with regard to charter cities, the code applies unless there is an express exemption or a charter city ordinance or regulation that is in direct conflict with the code.
This bill would provide that until January 1, 2028, the Public Contract Code applies to a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992, as specified.
This bill would declare that its provisions are a matter of statewide concern, and not a municipal affair.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for a city that is incorporated to promote commerce and industry, is located wholly within the County of Los Angeles, and had no residentially zoned land within its boundaries as of January 1, 1992.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
This bill would make a nonsubstantive change to this provision.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
This act shall be known and may be cited as the Fix Our Roads Act.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) According to the Governor, California faces a $5.7 billion annual shortfall in funding state highway maintenance and rehabilitation. Local governments have identified an additional $7.8 billion annual shortfall for maintaining local streets and roads.
(b) Ensuring the safe and efficient movement of goods and people is a fundamental role of government. California has neglected its roads and highways. According to the Department of Transportation (Caltrans), more than 15 percent of the state’s 50,000 miles of state highways are characterized as “distressed,” and require substantial rehabilitation and reconstruction work. An additional 25 percent of the state highway system is in need of corrective maintenance.
(c) California is ranked 45th in the United States by the Reason Foundation’s 21st Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems for overall highway condition and performance.
(d) According to The Road Information Program, a national transportation research group, congestion-related delays cost California motorists $20.4 billion every year. In Los Angeles and the Bay Area, the average motorist loses 61 hours due to congestion each year, costing $1,300 in lost time and wasted fuel. In the commercial sector, $1.34 trillion in goods are shipped from sites in California. According to the American Transportation Research Institute, traffic congestion in California adds over $1.7 billion annually in operational costs for the commercial trucking sector.
(e) According to the American Petroleum Institute, Californians pay the fourth highest gas tax in the nation.
(f) In 2015, the state’s cap-and-trade program was expanded to cover transportation fuels. According to the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission, this added an additional 10 cents to the cost of a gallon of gas. The Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates this tax will grow automatically to between 13 cents and 20 cents per gallon over the next five years. When this “hidden tax” is included, Californians pay the highest gas tax in the nation.
(g) This hidden tax on gasoline will generate between $1 billion and $3 billion per year in new revenue. None of this revenue supports road maintenance and rehabilitation.
(h) During the last recession, the Legislature diverted approximately $1 billion per year in truck weight fees from funding road maintenance and rehabilitation to backfill the state’s General Fund.
(i) General Fund spending grew by more than $15 billion between the 2013–14 and 2015–16 fiscal years. The weight fee diversion has not been reversed, and none of this new spending directly supported road maintenance or rehabilitation projects.
(j) The Legislative Analyst projects the state will have an $11.5 billion surplus in the 2016–17 fiscal year.
(k) The Legislature borrowed $482 million from the state’s Traffic Congestion Relief Program in 2001. None of this loan has been repaid.
(l) The Legislature is funding construction of a $68-billion-high-speed rail project. If constructed, this project would reduce traffic congestion by only 1 percent. In addition to more than $500 million per year in cap-and-trade revenue, taxpayers will pay $650 million per year in bond debt service over the next 30 years to fund this project.
(m) California does not spend existing road funds efficiently. The cost of meeting the state’s highway maintenance needs has nearly tripled over 10 years, while gas tax revenue for maintenance has remained steady. In May 2014, the Legislative Analyst released a review of staff support costs at Caltrans. The report determined that Caltrans is overstaffed by 3,500 full-time employees, at a cost of more than $500 million per year.
(n) Gas taxes and vehicle registration fees are regressive, and disproportionately harm low-income and middle class working families. Lower income Californians drive less fuel efficient vehicles, and commute longer distances due to the state’s lack of affordable housing.
(o) According to the American Automobile Association, Californians already pay the highest gas prices in the nation.
(p) The Governor proposes placing 1,500,000 zero-emission vehicles on California’s roads by 2025. Electric vehicle owners are disproportionately wealthy, and do not contribute any gas tax to pay for road maintenance and rehabilitation. According to an October 2015 University of California, Berkeley, study, the wealthiest 20 percent of households capture 90 percent of federal tax credits for electric vehicle purchases.
(q) Because electric vehicle owners do not pay gas tax, increasing the gas tax shifts the burden for roadway maintenance to lower income Californians.
(r) In September 2015, the Governor proposed a $500 million gas tax increase, and a $2 billion vehicle registration fee increase, to fund road maintenance and rehabilitation. The $65 registration fee increase would more than double the existing base registration fee.
SEC. 3.

Existing law requires the Department of Fish and Wildlife to administer the Significant Natural Areas Program, and requires the department, among other things, to develop and maintain a spatial data system that identifies those areas in the state that are most essential for maintaining habitat connectivity, including wildlife corridors and habitat linkages. Existing law requires the department, contingent upon the provision of certain funding, to investigate, study, and identify those areas in the state that are most essential as wildlife corridors and habitat linkages and prioritize vegetative data development in those areas. Existing law requires the department to seek input from representatives of other state agencies, local government, federal agencies, nongovernmental conservation organizations, landowners, agriculture, recreation, scientific entities, and industry in determining essential wildlife corridors and habitat linkages.
This bill would declare that it is the policy of the state to encourage, wherever feasible and practicable, voluntary steps to protect the functioning of wildlife corridors through various means, as applicable.
Existing law provides for the establishment of conservation banks, defined as publicly or privately owned and operated sites that are to be conserved and managed for habitat protection purposes in accordance with an agreement with the Department of Fish and Wildlife. Existing law provides for the issuance of credits by a conservation bank to, among other things, reduce adverse impacts to fish or wildlife resources from certain activities. Existing law also provides for the establishment of mitigation banks, as defined.
This bill would include within the authorized purposes of a conservation bank the protection of habitat connectivity for fish and wildlife resources.
This bill would provide that the fact that a project applicant does not take voluntary steps to protect the functioning of a wildlife corridor prior to initiating the application process for the project shall not be grounds for denying a permit or requiring additional mitigation beyond what is otherwise required by law to mitigate project impacts.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) More universal participation in postsecondary education in California is of vital public interest to ensure an informed citizenry, a functional democracy, a vibrant workforce, and a leading 21st century economy.
(b) Communities of color now comprise the new majority of California high school pupils. As cited by the University of California in an amicus brief filed in Fisher v. University of Texas, in 2012 high school graduates were 46.2 percent Latino, 30.5 percent white, 13.6 percent Asian or Pacific Islander, 6.7 percent African American, and 0.7 percent Native American.
(c) Despite outreach programs and other efforts, historically disadvantaged groups remain underrepresented. These groups include communities of color, immigrants, LGBTQ students, individuals from low-income and working class communities,access to higher education. This latter goal made California unique among the states and led to the creation of the most prominent higher education system in the nation and the world, a model that was replicated and revered. Undergirding this system and essential to its success was the commitment of California’s investment. Today, that commitment has changed as state resources that could have been made available for higher education have increasingly been dedicated to incarceration. According to the Public Policy Institute of California, from 2003 to 2010, inclusive, California’s prison population grew only 1 percent, while general fund expenditures on corrections increased by 26 percent.
(g) The Public Policy Institute of California projects that the state will fall short about 1,100,000 college graduates who will be in economic demand by 2030 if enrollment and graduation rates do not increase, and that highly educated workers from outside California are unlikely to fill this gap.
(h) Since 2012, when the California Postsecondary Education Commission was defunded, California has lacked a coordinating body for postsecondary education. The absence of such a body has reduced the ability of the state to effectively develop long-term plans for public postsecondary education and to fully engage with the public in the development of such plans.
(i) The Governor has acknowledged the well-established need for coordinating and guiding state higher education policy and has encouraged higher education stakeholders to explore alternative ways to more effectively improve coordination and development of higher education policy.
(j) Given this, and to ensure full and equitable accessibility to higher and postsecondary education, California must create and fund a Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education to develop a written plan to ensure that public universities and colleges in California are tuition-free and affordable to all students, including low-income and underrepresented students, and have the capacity to provide universal participation for all high school graduates by the year 2030.

(a) There is hereby created the Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education. The purpose of the commission is to make recommendations on improving access to and affordability in postsecondary education for Californians.
(b) (1) There shall be nine public members of the commission, who shall be California residents who are community leaders, business leaders, and others knowledgeable in the area of postsecondary education. The nine public members shall be representative of the cultural, ethnic, racial, and geographic diversity of the state. The members are as follows:
(A) Three members from the public appointed by the Governor.
(B) Three members from the public appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules.
(C) Three members from the public appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly.
(2) The Governor may designate any one of the nine members appointed to the commission to serve as temporary chairperson of the commission for its first meeting. The first order of business of the commission shall be to elect a permanent chairperson.
(c) Commission meetings are subject to the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act (Article 9 (commencing with Section 11120) of Chapter 1 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).
(d) Members of the commission shall serve without compensation, but shall receive reimbursement for actual and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the performance of their duties as members.
(e) No person who is employed or retained by any public or private postsecondary educational institution shall be appointed to or serve on the commission. No person who is a spouse or domestic partner of an employee, an officer, or retained by a public or private postsecondary educational institution shall be appointed to serve on the commission.
(f) (1) There shall be an office titled the Office of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Public Postsecondary Education. The office shall do all of the following:
(A) Implement the duties and directives of the commission.
(B) Consult with the higher education segments and stakeholders, as appropriate, in the conduct of its duties and responsibilities.
(2) The office may request and receive information necessary to conduct its business, from the higher education segments, the Department of Finance, the Legislative Analyst’s Office, and the Student Aid Commission.
(3) For purposes of this subdivision, “higher education segments” means the segments described in Section 66010.95. Higher education stakeholders include, but are not necessarily limited to, postsecondary faculty, staff, and students, K–12 representatives, representatives of the business community, representatives of labor, representatives of community-based organizations, and nonprofit organizations.
(g) (1) The office shall be established in state government, and shall be under the direct control of an executive director.
(2) The commission shall appoint the executive director at a salary that shall be fixed pursuant to Section 12001 of the Government Code.
(3) The commission shall select and designate a state administrative agency to carry out the personnel, contractual, and all other fiscal services required by the commission.
(h) The duties of the commission shall include, but need not be limited to, the review of relevant reports by the University of California, the California State University, the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, the Student Aid Commission, the Department of Finance, the Legislative Analyst’s Office, foundations or nonprofit organizations, the California Postsecondary Education Commission, or any other reports the commission deems appropriate.
(i) The commission shall conduct a series of at least 10 public hearings specifically focused on the needs of and seeking input from African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, boys and men of color, undocumented immigrants, LGBTQ students, and other underserved or underrepresented groups in public postsecondary education. The hearings shall be held in geographically diverse regions of the state to solicit testimony of individuals, public interest groups, alumni organizations, or any other interested private groups and organizations as well as professors, administrators, students, representatives from historically underrepresented groups in public higher education, and others who are directly affected for the purpose of soliciting the input of these groups in the formulations of the commission’s recommendations.
(j) In addition, the commission shall, at a minimum, study, analyze, issue written recommendations, and report to the Legislature and to the Governor on all of the following:
(1) Establishing the need to create a public postsecondary education system that ensures universal access with the capacity to support universal participation of all high school graduates in California.
(2) Identifying the current enrollment capacity in public postsecondary education as compared to the enrollment capacity needed in public postsecondary education to ensure universal access and universal participation for all high school graduates in California.
(3) Identifying the enrollment slots needed to ensure the state’s public postsecondary education system can graduate an additional 1,100,000 California residents by 2030 to meet the economic demands of the state.
(4) Determining the number of additional campuses needed, if any, in each of the public postsecondary education segments to accommodate the additional enrollment demands described in paragraphs (1) to (3), inclusive.

Under existing law, the Public Utilities Commission has regulatory authority over public utilities, including electrical corporations. The existing definition of an electrical corporation excludes from that definition a corporation or person employing landfill gas technology or digester gas technology for the generation of electricity for (1) its own use or the use of not more than 2 of its tenants located on the real property on which the electricity is generated, (2) the use of or sale to not more than 2 other corporations or persons solely for use on the real property on which the electricity is generated, or (3) the sale or transmission to an electrical corporation or state or local public agency, if the sale or transmission of the electricity service to a retail customer is provided through the transmission system of the existing local publicly owned electric utility or electrical corporation of that retail customer.
The California Renewables Portfolio Standard Program requires the Public Utilities Commission to establish a renewables portfolio standard requiring all retail sellers, as defined, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as defined, at specified percentages of the total kilowatthours sold to their retail end-customers during specified compliance periods. The program additionally requires each local publicly owned electric utility, as defined, to procure a minimum quantity of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources to achieve the targets established by the program. The program, consistent with the goals of procuring the least-cost and best-fit eligible renewable energy resources that meet project viability principles, requires that all retail sellers procure a balanced portfolio of electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources, as specified, referred to as the portfolio content requirements.
Existing law requires every electrical corporation to file with the commission a standard tariff for electricity generated by an electric generation facility, as defined, that qualifies for the tariff, is owned and operated by a retail customer of the electrical corporation, and is located within the service territory of, and developed to sell electricity to, the electrical corporation. This tariff requirement is known as the renewable feed-in tariff program. The program additionally requires the commission, by June 1, 2013, to direct the electrical corporations to collectively procure at least 250 megawatts of cumulative rated generating capacity from developers of bioenergy projects that commence operation on or after June 1, 2013. Pursuant to this requirement, the commission has established the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program.
This bill would provide that
unbundled
renewable energy credits may be used to meet the first category of the portfolio content requirements if (1) the credits are earned by electricity that is generated by an entity that, if it were a person or corporation, would be excluded from the definition of an electrical corporation by operation of the exclusions for a corporation or person employing landfill gas technology or digester gas technology, (2) the entity employing the landfill gas technology or digester gas technology has a first point of interconnection with a California balancing authority, a first point of interconnection with distribution facilities used to serve end users within a California balancing authority area, or
are
is
scheduled from the eligible renewable energy resource into a California balancing authority without substituting electricity from another source,
and
(3) where the electricity generated that earned the credit is used at a wastewater treatment facility that is owned by a public
entity and
entity, (4) the generating capability, as specified, of the wastewater treatment facility that earned the renewable energy credit is
first put into service on or after January 1,
2016.
2016, and (5) the wastewater treatment facility does not participate in the small-scale bioenergy feed-in tariff program. The bill would prohibit a public entity, selling renewable energy that is eligible to meet the first category of the portfolio content requirements pursuant to the bill’s provisions, from making any marketing or advertising claims regarding the renewable attributes of the electricity that earned the renewable energy credit. The bill would require that the electricity generated that earned the renewable energy credit that is sold by the public entity be added to the total retail sales of the retail seller or local publicly owned electric utility purchasing the renewable energy credit for purposes of determining their renewables portfolio standard procurement requirements.

The Political Reform Act of 1974 provides for the comprehensive regulation of campaign financing and related matters, including the reporting of gifts, as defined. The act prohibits specified officers from receiving gifts in excess of $440 in value from a single source in a calendar year. The act exempts gift payments for the actual costs of specified types of travel that are reasonably related to a legislative or governmental purpose, or to an issue of state, national, or international public policy, from the annual limit on the value of gifts from a single source.
This bill would require a nonprofit organization that regularly organizes and hosts travel for elected officials, as specified, and that pays for these types of travel for an elected state officer or local elected officeholder to disclose the names of donors who, in the preceding year, both donated to the nonprofit organization and accompanied an elected officer or officeholder for any portion of the travel, as specified. The bill would require a person who receives a gift of a travel payment from any source to report the travel destination on his or her statement of economic interests.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 87207 of the Government Code proposed by both this bill and AB 10, which would become operative only if both bills are enacted and become effective on or before January 1, 2016, and this bill is chaptered last.
A violation of the act’s provisions is punishable as a misdemeanor. By expanding the scope of an existing crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
The Political Reform Act of 1974, an initiative measure, provides that the Legislature may amend the act to further the act’s purposes upon a
2/3
vote of each house and compliance with specified procedural requirements.
This bill would declare that it furthers the purposes of the act.

(b)Funds shall be disbursed each fiscal year on a pro rata basis to counties that have established and maintain a county veterans service officer in accordance with the staffing level and workload of each county veterans service officer under a formula based upon performance that shall be developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs for these purposes, and that shall allocate county funds in any fiscal year for county veterans service officers in an amount not less than the amount allocated in the 1988–89 fiscal year.
(c)The department shall annually determine the amount of new or increased monetary benefits paid to eligible veterans by the federal government attributable to the assistance of county veterans service officers. The department shall, on or before October 1 of each year, prepare and transmit its determination for the preceding fiscal year to the Department of Finance and the Legislature. The Department of Finance shall review the department’s determination in time to use the information in the annual Budget Act for the budget of the department for the next fiscal year.
(d)(1)The Legislature finds and declares that 50 percent of the amount annually budgeted for county veterans service officers is approximately eleven million dollars ($11,000,000). The Legislature further finds and declares that it is an efficient and reasonable use of state funds to increase the annual budget for county veterans service officers in an amount not to exceed eleven million dollars ($11,000,000) if it is justified by the monetary benefits to the state’s veterans attributable to the effort of these officers.
(2)It is the intent of the Legislature, after reviewing the department’s determination in subdivision (c), to consider an increase in the annual budget for county veterans service officers in an amount not to exceed five million dollars ($5,000,000), if the monetary benefits to the state’s veterans attributable to the assistance of county veteran service officers justify that increase in the budget.
(e)This section shall become operative January 1, 2016.

Section 972.1 is added to the Military and Veterans Code, to read:
972.1.
(a) The Department of Veterans Affairs shall, no later than July 1, 2016, develop an allocation formula based upon performance standards that encourage innovation and reward outstanding service by county veterans service officers. Upon appropriation by the Legislature of moneys for this purpose, the moneys shall be allocated each fiscal year in accordance with that formula among only those counties that, in the discretion of the secretary, comply with the following requirements:
(1) Establish and maintain a county veterans service officer, pursuant to Section 970.
(2) Collect and report all information required by the department in accordance with departmental regulations.
(3) Comply with the training and accreditation standards for county veterans service officers and veteran service representatives as may be set by the department.
(4) Require county veterans service officers and veteran service representatives to become accredited with the department for the purpose of providing representation services to claimants before the United States Department of Veterans Affairs within 18 months of the commencement of his or her employment, or on or before June 1, 2017, whichever date is later.
(b) The department shall annually report to the Legislature the efficacy, return on investment, work volume, and regional impact of the subvention funds on each county that receives those funds. The department shall, in addition to the requirements of Section 974, annually determine information including, but not limited to, the following:
(1) The amount of new or increased monetary benefits paid to eligible veterans by the federal government attributable to the assistance of county veterans service officers and the basis for that determination.
(2) The amount paid to each county, including the amounts paid to each county for each category of workload unit included in the allocation formula.
(3) An evaluation as to each county’s use of subvention funds, including recommendations for improvement of each county’s use of subvention funds.
(c) The department shall, on or before October 1 of each year, prepare and transmit its determination for the preceding fiscal year to the Department of Finance and the Legislature. The Department of Finance shall review the department’s determination in time to use the information in the annual Budget Act for the budget of the department for the next fiscal year. The department may combine this report with the report required by Section 974.
(d) For the purposes of this section, “workload unit” means a specific claim activity that is used to allocate subvention funds to counties, which is approved by the department, and performed by county veterans service officers.
(e) It is the intent of the Legislature that the department revise the allocation formula pursuant to this section on a regular basis to adjust for changes in veteran demographics and veteran needs.
SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a)The recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are creating an entirely new generation of veterans who may be eligible for federal veterans benefits because of their war service and their physical and mental conditions.
(b)Californians make up to 10 percent of the federal military forces used in these conflicts. Furthermore, the California National Guard and California-based reserve units have contributed significantly to these current conflicts.
(c)Many of these returning California veterans are not aware of the federal and state benefits that are available to them.
(d)Additionally, it is estimated that in California there may be over two million veterans, and their widows or widowers, who are unaware that they may be eligible for pensions from the federal government based upon their, or their spouses’, past military service in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, or the Gulf War.
(e)California’s county veterans service officers are the initial local point of contact for claimants accessing the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.
(f)The costs of maintaining county veterans service officers are shared from county general funds and state reimbursement to the counties. In 1997, in order to track performance, the Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Senate Bill 608, enacted as Chapter 318 of the Statutes of 1997, which required the California Department of Veterans Affairs to annually report the amount of monetary benefits paid to veterans by the federal government that were attributable to the assistance of county veterans service officers. Senate Bill 608 also required the Department of Finance to consider an increase in the annual budget for county veterans service officers of up to $5 million, if approved in the annual budget process. In 2009, the Legislature enacted and the Governor signed into law Senate Bill 419 enacted as Chapter 183 of the Statutes of 2009, which raised this amount to $11 million, if approved in the annual budget process.
(g)As a result of this annual reporting, by the end of 2013, it had been determined that from 1995 to 2013, inclusive, the state had cumulatively budgeted $41.4 million for its share of the cost of the county veterans service officers. As a result of this investment, county veteran service officers were able to assist local veterans in obtaining $4.1 billion, in new federal moneys. This is a return of about $98 for every $1 the state allocates to county veterans service officers. Furthermore, the $4.1 billion only reflects the actual monetary benefits qualified for in a given year. The monetary benefits qualified for in prior years are not tracked, yet the veterans and their dependents may continue to receive those benefits for the rest of their lives. Added to this stellar return on the state’s investment, but not counted in the annual reporting, are the Medi-Cal cost avoidance savings incurred as a result of county veterans service officers qualifying and shifting veterans away from Medi-Cal and into the appropriate federal veterans program.
(h)The county veterans service officers had accomplished all of this without ever reaching the allowable state budget allocation of $11 million, set in 2009. To date, the county veterans service officers have not received more than $5.6 million per year from the state.
(i)It is critical that the county veterans service officers receive a steady stream of funding because there continues to be a large number of underserved veterans and their dependents who are not aware of the federal benefits available to them as a result of their military service. Studies from other states have shown that increases in county veterans service officers have resulted in larger amounts of federal moneys to veterans. These new federal moneys and benefits are paid directly from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to the qualifying veteran or their dependent and are used in the local economy.

(1)For the purposes of this section, “workload unit” means a specific claim activity that is used to allocate subvention funds to counties, which is approved by the department, and performed by county veterans service officers.
(2)For the purposes of this subdivision, the department, by June 30, 2013, shall develop a performance-based formula that will incentivize county veterans service officers to perform workload units that help veterans access federal compensation and pension benefits and other benefits, in order to maximize the amount of federal money received by California veterans.
(b)The department shall annually determine the amount of new or increased monetary benefits paid to eligible veterans by the federal government attributable to the assistance of county veterans service officers. The department shall, on or before October 1 of each year, prepare and transmit its determination for the preceding fiscal year to the Department of Finance and the Legislature. The Department of Finance shall review the department’s determination in time to use the information in the annual Budget Act for the budget of the department for the next fiscal year.
(c)The department shall conduct a review of the high-performing and low-performing county veterans service officers, and, based on this review, shall produce a best-practices manual for county veterans service officers by June 30, 2013.
(d)The Legislature finds and declares that it is an efficient and reasonable use of state funds to increase the annual budget for county veterans service officers up to a total of eleven million dollars ($11,000,000) if it is justified by the monetary benefits to the state’s veterans attributable to the effort of these officers.
(e)This section shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2016, and as of that date is repealed.

Moneys appropriated pursuant to this subdivision shall only be available for encumbrance and expenditure for one year after the date upon which it first becomes available for encumbrance.
(b)The Department of Veterans Affairs shall, no later than July 1, 2016, develop an allocation formula based upon performance standards that encourage innovation and reward outstanding service by county veterans service officers. Moneys appropriated for this purpose shall be allocated each fiscal year in accordance with that formula among those counties that have established and maintained a county veterans service officer pursuant to Section 970.
SEC. 5.

(4) The department may charge a fee for registration of up to twenty dollars ($20) per person but not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. After the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, fees charged shall increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department’s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act but not to exceed the reasonable costs of the department. The fees shall be deposited into the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account.
(b) (1) Any person who, from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2016, inclusive, lawfully possessed an assault weapon that does not have a fixed magazine, as defined in Section 30515, including those weapons with an ammunition feeding device that can be readily removed from the firearm with the use of a tool, shall register the firearm before January 1, 2018, but not before the effective date of the regulations adopted pursuant to paragraph (5), with the department pursuant to those procedures that the department may establish by regulation pursuant to paragraph (5).
(2) Registrations shall be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department.
(3) The registration shall contain a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely, including all identification marks, the date the firearm was acquired, the name and address of the individual from whom, or business from which, the firearm was acquired, as well as the registrant’s full name, address, telephone number, date of birth, sex, height, weight, eye color, hair color, and California driver’s license number or California identification card number.
(4) The department may charge a fee in an amount of up to fifteen dollars ($15) per person but not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The fee shall be paid by debit or credit card at the time that the electronic registration is submitted to the department. The fee shall be deposited in the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account to be used for purposes of this section.
(5) The department shall adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing this subdivision. These regulations are exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).
SEC. 4.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.

Actual Output
(1) Existing law generally prohibits the possession or transfer of assault weapons, except for the sale, purchase, importation, or possession of assault weapons by specified individuals, including law enforcement officers. Under existing law, “assault weapon” means, among other things, a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that has the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and has any one of
several
specified attributes, including, for rifles, a thumbhole stock, and for pistols, a 2nd handgrip.
This bill would revise this definition of “assault weapon” to mean a semiautomatic centerfire rifle or a semiautomatic pistol that does not have a fixed magazine but has any one of those specified attributes. The bill would also define “fixed magazine” to mean an ammunition feeding device contained in, or permanently attached to, a firearm in such a manner that the device cannot be removed without disassembly of the firearm action.
By expanding the definition of an existing crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(2) Existing law makes any person who, within this state, possesses an assault weapon, except as otherwise provided, guilty of a misdemeanor or a felony.
This bill would exempt from punishment under that prohibition a person who possessed an assault weapon prior to January 1, 2017, if specified requirements are met.
(3) Existing law requires that, with specified exceptions, any person who, prior to January 1, 2001, lawfully possessed an assault weapon prior to the date it was defined as an assault weapon, and which was not specified as an assault weapon at the time of lawful possession, register the firearm with the Department of Justice. Existing law permits the Department of Justice to charge a fee for registration of up to $20 per person but not to exceed the actual processing costs of the department. Existing law, after the department establishes fees sufficient to reimburse the department for processing costs, requires fees charged to increase at a rate not to exceed the legislatively approved annual cost-of-living adjustment for the department’s budget or as otherwise increased through the Budget Act. Existing law requires those fees to be deposited into the Dealers’ Record of Sale Special Account. Existing law, the Administrative Procedure Act, establishes the requirements for the adoption, publication, review, and implementation of regulations by state agencies.
This bill would require that any person who, from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2016, inclusive, lawfully possessed an assault weapon that does not have a fixed magazine, as defined,
and
including those weapons with an ammunition feeding device that can be removed readily from the firearm with the use of a tool, register the firearm with the Department of Justice before January 1, 2018, but not before the effective date of specified regulations. The bill would permit the department to increase the $20 registration fee as long as it does not exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department. The bill would also require registrations to be submitted electronically via the Internet utilizing a public-facing application made available by the department. The bill would require the registration to contain specified information, including, but not limited to, a description of the firearm that identifies it uniquely and specified information about the registrant. The bill would permit the department to charge a fee of up to $15 per person for registration through the Internet, not to exceed the reasonable processing costs of the department to be paid and deposited, as specified, for purposes of the registration program. The bill would require the department to adopt regulations for the purpose of implementing those provisions and would exempt those regulations from the Administrative Procedure Act. The bill would also make technical and conforming changes.
(4) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
(5) This bill would become operative only if SB 880 of the 2015–16 Regular Session is enacted and takes effect on or before January 1, 2017.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 1793.2 of the Civil Code is amended to read:
1793.2.
(a) Every manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state and for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty shall:
(1) (A) Maintain in this state sufficient service and repair facilities reasonably close to all areas where its consumer goods are sold to carry out the terms of those warranties or designate and authorize in this state as service and repair facilities independent repair or service facilities reasonably close to all areas where its consumer goods are sold to carry out the terms of the warranties.
(B) As a means of complying with this paragraph, a manufacturer may enter into warranty service contracts with independent service and repair facilities. The warranty service contracts may provide for a fixed schedule of rates to be charged for warranty service or warranty repair work. However, the rates fixed by those contracts shall be in conformity with the requirements of subdivision (c) of Section 1793.3. The rates established pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 1793.3, between the manufacturer and the independent service and repair facility, do not preclude a good faith discount that is reasonably related to reduced credit and general overhead cost factors arising from the manufacturer’s payment of warranty charges direct to the independent service and repair facility. The warranty service contracts authorized by this paragraph may not be executed to cover a period of time in excess of one year, and may be renewed only by a separate, new contract or letter of agreement between the manufacturer and the independent service and repair facility.
(2) In the event of a failure to comply with paragraph (1) of this subdivision, be subject to Section 1793.5.
(3) Make available to authorized service and repair facilities sufficient service literature and replacement parts to effect repairs during the express warranty period.
(b) Where those service and repair facilities are maintained in this state and service or repair of the goods is necessary because they do not conform with the applicable express warranties, service and repair shall be commenced within a reasonable time by the manufacturer or its representative in this state. Unless the buyer agrees in writing to the contrary, the goods shall be serviced or repaired so as to conform to the applicable warranties within 30 days. Delay caused by conditions beyond the control of the manufacturer or its representatives shall serve to extend this 30-day requirement. Where delay arises, conforming goods shall be tendered as soon as possible following termination of the condition giving rise to the delay.
(c) The buyer shall deliver nonconforming goods to the manufacturer’s service and repair facility within this state, unless, due to reasons of size and weight, or method of attachment, or method of installation, or nature of the nonconformity, delivery cannot reasonably be accomplished. If the buyer cannot return the nonconforming goods for any of these reasons, he or she shall notify the manufacturer or its nearest service and repair facility within the state. Written notice of nonconformity to the manufacturer or its service and repair facility shall constitute return of the goods for purposes of this section. Upon receipt of that notice of nonconformity, the manufacturer shall, at its option, service or repair the goods at the buyer’s residence, or pick up the goods for service and repair, or arrange for transporting the goods to its service and repair facility. All reasonable costs of transporting the goods when a buyer cannot return them for any of the above reasons shall be at the manufacturer’s expense. The reasonable costs of transporting nonconforming goods after delivery to the service and repair facility until return of the goods to the buyer shall be at the manufacturer’s expense.
(d) (1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), if the manufacturer or its representative in this state does not service or repair the goods to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either replace the goods or reimburse the buyer in an amount equal to the purchase price paid by the buyer, less that amount directly attributable to use by the buyer prior to the discovery of the nonconformity.
(2) If the manufacturer or its representative in this state is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle, as that term is defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 1793.22, to conform to the applicable express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either promptly replace the new motor vehicle in accordance with subparagraph (A) or promptly make restitution to the buyer in accordance with subparagraph (B). However, the buyer shall be free to elect restitution in lieu of replacement, and in no event shall the buyer be required by the manufacturer to accept a replacement vehicle.
(A) In the case of replacement, the manufacturer shall replace the buyer’s vehicle with a new motor vehicle substantially identical to the vehicle replaced. The replacement vehicle shall be accompanied by all express and implied warranties that normally accompany new motor vehicles of that specific kind. The manufacturer also shall pay for, or to, the buyer the amount of any sales or use tax, license fees, registration fees, and other official fees which the buyer is obligated to pay in connection with the replacement, plus any incidental damages to which the buyer is entitled under Section 1794, including, but not limited to,
the lesser of
reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs
and those costs
actually incurred by the buyer.
(B) In the case of restitution, the manufacturer shall make restitution in an amount equal to the actual price paid or payable by the buyer, including any charges for transportation and manufacturer-installed options, but excluding nonmanufacturer items installed by a dealer or the buyer, and including any collateral charges such as sales or use tax, license fees, registration fees, and other official fees, plus any incidental damages to which the buyer is entitled under Section 1794, including, but not limited to, reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs actually incurred by the buyer.
(C) When the manufacturer replaces the new motor vehicle pursuant to subparagraph (A), the buyer shall only be liable to pay the manufacturer an amount directly attributable to use by the buyer of the replaced vehicle prior to the time the buyer first delivered the vehicle to the manufacturer or distributor, or its authorized service and repair facility for correction of the problem that gave rise to the nonconformity. When restitution is made pursuant to subparagraph (B), the amount to be paid by the manufacturer to the buyer may be reduced by the manufacturer by that amount directly attributable to use by the buyer prior to the time the buyer first delivered the vehicle to the manufacturer or distributor, or its authorized service and repair facility for correction of the problem that gave rise to the nonconformity. The amount directly attributable to use by the buyer shall be determined by multiplying the actual price of the new motor vehicle paid or payable by the buyer, including any charges for transportation and manufacturer-installed options, by a fraction having as its denominator 120,000 and having as its numerator the number of miles traveled by the new motor vehicle prior to the time the buyer first delivered the vehicle to the manufacturer or distributor, or its authorized service and repair facility for correction of the problem that gave rise to the nonconformity. Nothing in this paragraph shall in any way limit the rights or remedies available to the buyer under any other law.
(D) Pursuant to Section 1795.4, a buyer of a new motor vehicle shall also include a lessee of a new motor vehicle.
(e) (1) If the goods cannot practicably be serviced or repaired by the manufacturer or its representative to conform to the applicable express warranties because of the method of installation or because the goods have become so affixed to real property as to become a part thereof, the manufacturer shall either replace and install the goods or reimburse the buyer in an amount equal to the purchase price paid by the buyer, including installation costs, less that amount directly attributable to use by the buyer prior to the discovery of the nonconformity.
(2) With respect to claims arising out of deficiencies in the construction of a new residential dwelling, paragraph (1) shall not apply to either of the following:
(A) A product that is not a manufactured product, as defined in subdivision (g) of Section 896.
(B) A claim against a person or entity that is not the manufacturer that originally made the express warranty for that manufactured product.
SECTION 1.
Section 1793.22 of the
Civil Code
is amended to read:
1793.22.
(a)This section shall be known, and may be cited as, the Tanner Consumer Protection Act.
(b)It shall be presumed that a reasonable number of attempts have been made to conform a new motor vehicle to the applicable express warranties if, within 18 months from delivery to the buyer or 18,000 miles on the odometer of the vehicle, whichever occurs first, one or more of the following conditions occur:
(1)The same nonconformity results in a condition that is likely to cause death or serious bodily injury if the vehicle is driven and the nonconformity has been subject to repair two or more times by the manufacturer or its agents, and the buyer or lessee has at least once directly notified the manufacturer of the need for the repair of the nonconformity.
(2)The same nonconformity has been subject to repair four or more times by the manufacturer or its agents and the buyer has at least once directly notified the manufacturer of the need for the repair of the nonconformity.
(3)The vehicle is out of service by reason of repair of nonconformities by the manufacturer or its agents for a cumulative total of more than 30 calendar days since delivery of the vehicle to the buyer. The 30-day limit shall be extended only if repairs cannot be performed due to conditions beyond the control of the manufacturer or its agents. The buyer shall be required to directly notify the manufacturer pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) only if the manufacturer has clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the buyer, with the warranty or the owner’s manual, the provisions of this section and that of subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2, including the requirement that the buyer must notify the manufacturer directly pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2). The notification, if required, shall be sent to the address, if any, specified clearly and conspicuously by the manufacturer in the warranty or owner’s manual. This presumption shall be a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof, and it may be asserted by the buyer in any civil action, including an action in small claims court, or other formal or informal proceeding.
(c)If a qualified third-party dispute resolution process exists, and the buyer receives timely notification in writing of the availability of that qualified third-party dispute resolution process with a description of its operation and effect, the presumption in subdivision (b) may not be asserted by the buyer until after the buyer has initially resorted to the qualified third-party dispute resolution process as required in subdivision (d). Notification of the availability of the qualified third-party dispute resolution process is not timely if the buyer suffers any prejudice resulting from any delay in giving the notification. If a qualified third-party dispute resolution process does not exist, or if the buyer is dissatisfied with that third-party decision, or if the manufacturer or its agent neglects to promptly fulfill the terms of the qualified third-party dispute resolution process decision after the decision is accepted by the buyer, the buyer may assert the presumption provided in subdivision (b) in an action to enforce the buyer’s rights under subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2. The findings and decision of a qualified third-party dispute resolution process shall be admissible in evidence in the action without further foundation. Any period of limitation of actions under any federal or California laws with respect to any person shall be extended for a period equal to the number of days between the date a complaint is filed with a third-party dispute resolution process and the date of its decision or the date before which the manufacturer or its agent is required by the decision to fulfill its terms if the decision is accepted by the buyer, whichever occurs later.
(d)A qualified third-party dispute resolution process shall be one that does all of the following:
(1)Complies with the minimum requirements of the Federal Trade Commission for informal dispute settlement procedures as set forth in Part 703 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations, as those regulations read on January 1, 1987.
(2)Renders decisions which are binding on the manufacturer if the buyer elects to accept the decision.
(3)Prescribes a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days after the decision is accepted by the buyer, within which the manufacturer or its agent must fulfill the terms of its decisions.
(4)Provides arbitrators who are assigned to decide disputes with copies of, and instruction in, the provisions of the Federal Trade Commission’s regulations in Part 703 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations as those regulations read on January 1, 1987, Division 2 (commencing with Section 2101) of the Commercial Code, and this chapter.
(5)Requires the manufacturer, when the process orders, under the terms of this chapter, either that the nonconforming motor vehicle be replaced if the buyer consents to this remedy or that restitution be made to the buyer, to replace the motor vehicle or make restitution in accordance with paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2.
(6)Provides, at the request of the arbitrator or a majority of the arbitration panel, for an inspection and written report on the condition of a nonconforming motor vehicle, at no cost to the buyer, by an automobile expert who is independent of the manufacturer.
(7)Takes into account, in rendering decisions, all legal and equitable factors, including, but not limited to, the written warranty, the rights and remedies conferred in regulations of the Federal Trade Commission contained in Part 703 of Title 16 of the Code of Federal Regulations as those regulations read on January 1, 1987, Division 2 (commencing with Section 2101) of the Commercial Code, this chapter, and any other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Nothing in this chapter requires that, to be certified as a qualified third-party dispute resolution process pursuant to this section, decisions of the process must consider or provide remedies in the form of awards of punitive damages or multiple damages, under subdivision (c) of Section 1794, or of attorneys’ fees under subdivision (d) of Section 1794, or of consequential damages other than as provided in subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 1794, including, but not limited to, reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs actually incurred by the buyer.
(8)Requires that no arbitrator deciding a dispute may be a party to the dispute and that no other person, including an employee, agent, or dealer for the manufacturer, may be allowed to participate substantively in the merits of any dispute with the arbitrator unless the buyer is allowed to participate also. Nothing in this subdivision prohibits any member of an arbitration board from deciding a dispute.
(9)Obtains and maintains certification by the Department of Consumer Affairs pursuant to Chapter 9 (commencing with Section 472) of Division 1 of the Business and Professions Code.
(e)For the purposes of subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2 and this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1)“Nonconformity” means a nonconformity which substantially impairs the use, value, or safety of the new motor vehicle to the buyer or lessee.
(2)“New motor vehicle” means a new motor vehicle that is bought or used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. “New motor vehicle” also means a new motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight under 10,000 pounds that is bought or used primarily for business purposes by a person, including a partnership, limited liability company, corporation, association, or any other legal entity, to which not more than five motor vehicles are registered in this state. “New motor vehicle” includes the chassis, chassis cab, and that portion of a motor home devoted to its propulsion, but does not include any portion designed, used, or maintained primarily for human habitation, a dealer-owned vehicle and a “demonstrator” or other motor vehicle sold with a manufacturer’s new car warranty but does not include a motorcycle or a motor vehicle which is not registered under the Vehicle Code because it is to be operated or used exclusively off the highways. A demonstrator is a vehicle assigned by a dealer for the purpose of demonstrating qualities and characteristics common to vehicles of the same or similar model and type.
(3)“Motor home” means a vehicular unit built on, or permanently attached to, a self-propelled motor vehicle chassis, chassis cab, or van, which becomes an integral part of the completed vehicle, designed for human habitation for recreational or emergency occupancy.
(f)(1)Except as provided in paragraph (2), no person shall sell, either at wholesale or retail, lease, or transfer a motor vehicle transferred by a buyer or lessee to a manufacturer pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 1793.2 or a similar statute of any other state, unless the nature of the nonconformity experienced by the original buyer or lessee is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the prospective buyer, lessee, or transferee, the nonconformity is corrected, and the manufacturer warrants to the new buyer, lessee, or transferee in writing for a period of one year that the motor vehicle is free of that nonconformity.
(2)Except for the requirement that the nature of the nonconformity be disclosed to the transferee, paragraph (1) does not apply to the transfer of a motor vehicle to an educational institution if the purpose of the transfer is to make the motor vehicle available for use in automotive repair courses.

Existing law requires a manufacturer of consumer goods sold in this state for which the manufacturer has made an express warranty to maintain sufficient service and repair facilities reasonably close where its goods are sold to carry out the terms of those warranties or to designate and authorize independent repair or service facilities to fulfill this purpose. Existing law requires a manufacturer that is unable to service or repair a new motor vehicle to conform to the express warranties after a reasonable number of attempts to replace the vehicle or promptly make restitution. Existing law requires a manufacturer, in the case of a replacement, to also pay other specified costs, including reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs actually incurred by the buyer.
This bill, in the case of a new motor vehicle replacement as described above, would require the manufacturer to pay the lesser of reasonable repair, towing, and rental car costs and those costs actually incurred by the buyer.
Existing law, the Tanner Consumer Protection Act, establishes a presumption that a reasonable number of attempts have been made to conform a new motor vehicle to the applicable express warranties if, within 18 months from delivery or 18,000 miles on the odometer, whichever occurs first, one or more conditions occur.
This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.

Actual Output
Existing law provides for the annual assessment and collection of property taxes by each county, and provides for the state administration of the property tax by the State Board of Equalization.
The California Constitution generally limits ad valorem taxes on real property to 1% of the full cash value of that property. For purposes of this limitation, “full cash value” is defined as the assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975–76 tax bill under “full cash value” or, thereafter, the appraised value of that real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred.
Existing property tax law requires a transferee of real property or a manufactured home that is locally assessed to file a change in ownership statement with the assessor of the county in which the property or manufactured home is located, and also requires a corporation, partnership, limited liability company, or other legal entity to file a change in ownership statement with the board.
Existing property tax law also includes various property tax exemptions as authorized or established by the California Constitution.
This bill would prohibit an assessor or any person employed by the office of the county assessor from making decisions with regard to change in ownership, or with regard to property tax exemptions, except a homeowners’ exemption claim, unless he or she is the holder of a valid assessment analyst certificate issued by the board. The bill would require the board to provide for the examination of applicants for a certificate and would authorize the board to contract with the Department of Human Resources to give the examinations. The bill would require prescribed annual training for certification, and would also provide for advanced certification. Failure to complete training as required would be grounds for revocation. The bill would also authorize the board to issue temporary certificates and interim certificates under prescribed circumstances. This bill would specify that its provisions are not to be construed to impede assessors from managing their staff resources efficiently regarding exemption applications and change in ownership documents, provided that noncertificated staff are not responsible for making exemption or change in ownership decisions. This bill would provide that its provisions only apply in those counties and cities and counties that have passed a resolution upon the recommendation of the assessor to require certification as described above.

Existing law relating to property transfers prohibits the acknowledgment of an instrument unless the officer taking it has satisfactory evidence that the person making the acknowledgment is the individual who is described in and who executed the instrument. Existing law provides that an officer may reasonably rely on, among other things, a passport issued by a foreign government, a driver’s license issued by another state or a Canadian or Mexican public agency, an identification card issued by another state or a branch of the Armed Forces of the United States, or an employee identification card issued by an agency or office of this state or a city, county, or city and county in this state, provided that the document meets certain requirements. In the event the document is a passport, it must be stamped by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security.
This bill, instead of that provision pertaining to a passport issued by a foreign government, would authorize the acceptance of a valid passport from the applicant’s country of citizenship, or a valid consular identification document issued by a consulate from the applicant’s country of citizenship, as proof of identity. The bill would eliminate the requirement that the passport be stamped by the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 1185 of the Civil Code proposed by SB 997 that would become operative if this bill and SB 997 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 124977 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
124977.
(a) It is the intent of the Legislature that, unless otherwise specified, the genetic disease testing program carried out pursuant to this chapter be fully supported from fees collected for services provided by the program.
(b) (1) The department shall charge a fee to all payers for any tests or activities performed pursuant to this chapter. The amount of the fee shall be established by regulation and periodically adjusted by the director in order to meet the costs of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other law, any fees charged for prenatal screening and followup services provided to persons enrolled in the Medi-Cal program, health care service plan enrollees, or persons covered by health insurance policies, shall be paid in full and deposited in the Genetic Disease Testing Fund or the Birth Defects Monitoring Program Fund consistent with this section.
(2) The department shall expeditiously undertake all steps necessary to implement the fee collection process, including personnel, contracts, and data processing, so as to initiate the fee collection process at the earliest opportunity.
(3) Effective for services provided on and after July 1, 2002, the department shall charge a fee to the hospital of birth, or, for births not occurring in a hospital, to families of the newborn, for newborn screening and followup services. The hospital of birth and families of newborns born outside the hospital shall make payment in full to the Genetic Disease Testing Fund. The department shall not charge or bill Medi-Cal beneficiaries for services provided pursuant to this chapter.
(4) (A) The department shall charge a fee for prenatal screening to support the pregnancy blood sample storage, testing, and research activities of the Birth Defects Monitoring Program.
(B) The prenatal screening fee for activities of the Birth Defects Monitoring Program shall be ten dollars ($10).
(5) The department shall set guidelines for invoicing, charging, and collecting from approved researchers the amount necessary to cover all expenses associated with research application requests made pursuant to this section, data linkage, retrieval, data processing, data entry, reinventory, and shipping of blood samples or their components, and related data management.
(6) The only funds from the Genetic Disease Testing Fund that may be used for the purpose of supporting the pregnancy blood sample storage, testing, and research activities of the Birth Defects Monitoring Program are those prenatal screening fees assessed and collected prior to the creation of the Birth Defects Monitoring Program Fund specifically to support those Birth Defects Monitoring Program activities.
(7) The Birth Defects Monitoring Program Fund is hereby created as a special fund in the State Treasury. Fee revenues that are collected pursuant to paragraph (4) shall be deposited into the fund and shall be available upon appropriation by the Legislature to support the pregnancy blood sample storage, testing, and research activities of the Birth Defects Monitoring Program. Notwithstanding Section 16305.7 of the Government Code, interest earned on funds in the Birth Defects Monitoring Program Fund shall be deposited as revenue into the fund to support the Birth Defects Monitoring Program.
(c) (1) The Legislature finds that timely implementation of changes in genetic screening programs and continuous maintenance of quality statewide services requires expeditious regulatory and administrative procedures to obtain the most cost-effective electronic data processing, hardware, software services, testing equipment, and testing and followup services.
(2) The expenditure of funds from the Genetic Disease Testing Fund for these purposes shall not be subject to Section 12102 of, and Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 10290) of Part 2 of Division 2 of, the Public Contract Code, or to Division 25.2 (commencing with Section 38070) of this code. The department shall provide the Department of Finance with documentation that equipment and services have been obtained at the lowest cost consistent with technical requirements for a comprehensive high-quality program.
(3) The expenditure of funds from the Genetic Disease Testing Fund for implementation of the Tandem Mass Spectrometry screening for fatty acid oxidation, amino acid, and organic acid disorders, and screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be implemented through the amendment of the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System contracts and shall not be subject to Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 12100) of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code, Article 4 (commencing with Section 19130) of Chapter 5 of Part 2 of Division 5 of Title 2 of the Government Code, and any policies, procedures, regulations, or manuals authorized by those laws.
(4) The expenditure of funds from the Genetic Disease Testing Fund for the expansion of the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System to include cystic fibrosis, biotinidase, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), and any other disease that is detectable in blood samples, as specified in subdivision (d) of Section 125001, may be implemented through the amendment of the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System contracts, and shall not be subject to Chapter 2 (commencing with Section 10290) or Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 12100) of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Public Contract Code, Article 4 (commencing with Section 19130) of Chapter 5 of Part 2 of Division 5 of Title 2 of the Government Code, or Sections 4800 to 5180, inclusive, of the State Administrative Manual as they relate to approval of information technology projects or approval of increases in the duration or costs of information technology projects. This paragraph shall apply to the design, development, and implementation of the expansion, and to the maintenance and operation of the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System, including change requests, once the expansion is implemented.
(d) (1) The department may adopt emergency regulations to implement and make specific this chapter in accordance with Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code. For the purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act, the adoption of regulations shall be deemed an emergency and necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety, or general welfare. Notwithstanding Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, these emergency regulations shall not be subject to the review and approval of the Office of Administrative Law. Notwithstanding Sections 11346.1 and 11349.6 of the Government Code, the department shall submit these regulations directly to the Secretary of State for filing. The regulations shall become effective immediately upon filing by the Secretary of State. Regulations shall be subject to public hearing within 120 days of filing with the Secretary of State and shall comply with Sections 11346.8 and 11346.9 of the Government Code or shall be repealed.
(2) The Office of Administrative Law shall provide for the printing and publication of these regulations in the California Code of Regulations. Notwithstanding Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code, the regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter shall not be repealed by the Office of Administrative Law and shall remain in effect until revised or repealed by the department.
(3) The Legislature finds and declares that the health and safety of California newborns is in part dependent on an effective and adequately staffed genetic disease program, the cost of which shall be supported by the fees generated by the program.
SEC. 2.
Section 125001 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
125001.
(a) The department shall establish a program for the development, provision, and evaluation of genetic disease testing, and may provide laboratory testing facilities or make grants to, contract with, or make payments to, any laboratory that it deems qualified and cost effective to conduct testing or with any metabolic specialty clinic to provide necessary treatment with qualified specialists. The program shall provide genetic screening and followup services for persons who have the screening.
(b) The department shall expand statewide screening of newborns to include tandem mass spectrometry screening for fatty acid oxidation, amino acid, organic acid disorders, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia as soon as possible. The department shall provide information with respect to these disorders and available testing resources to all women receiving prenatal care and to all women admitted to a hospital for delivery. If the department is unable to provide this statewide screening by August 1, 2005, the department shall temporarily obtain these testing services through a competitive bid process from one or more public or private laboratories that meet the department’s requirements for testing, quality assurance, and reporting. If the department determines that contracting for these services is more cost effective, and meets the other requirements of this chapter, than purchasing the tandem mass spectrometry equipment themselves, the department shall contract with one or more public or private laboratories.
(c) The department shall expand statewide screening of newborns to include screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) as soon as possible. In implementing the SCID screening test, the department shall also screen for other T-cell lymphopenias that are detectable as a result of screening for SCID, insofar as it does not require additional costs or equipment beyond that needed to test for SCID.
(d) The department shall expand statewide screening of newborns to include screening for adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and any other disease that is detectable in blood samples as soon as practicable, but no later than two years after the disease is adopted by the federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), or enrollment of the act amending this subdivision, whichever is later.

Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health to establish a program for the development, provision, and evaluation of genetic disease testing.
Existing law establishes the continuously appropriated Genetic Disease Testing Fund (GDTF), consisting of fees paid for newborn screening tests, and states the intent of the Legislature that all costs of the genetic disease testing program be fully supported by fees paid for newborn screening tests, which are deposited in the GDTF. Existing law also authorizes moneys in the GDTF to be used for the expansion of the Genetic Disease Branch Screening Information System to include cystic fibrosis, biotinidase, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) and exempts the expansion of contracts for this purpose from certain provisions of the Public Contract Code, the Government Code, and the State Administrative Manual, as specified.
This bill would require the department to expand statewide screening of newborns to include screening for any disease that is detectable in blood samples as soon as practicable, but no later than 2 years after the disease is adopted by the federal Recommended Uniform Screening Panel (RUSP), or enrollment of this bill, whichever is later. By expanding the purposes for which moneys from the GDTF may be expended, this bill would make an appropriation.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Article 1 (commencing with Section 104250) is added to Chapter 4 of Part 1 of Division 103 of the Health and Safety Code, to read:
Article  1. Diabetes.
104250.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) It is reported that one in seven adult Californians has diabetes, and the numbers are rising rapidly. The actual number of those whose lives are affected by diabetes is unknown and stands to be much higher when factoring in the incidence of type 1 diabetes and undiagnosed gestational diabetes.
(b) California has the greatest number of annual new cases of diabetes in the United States.
(c) The incidence of diabetes amongst all Californians has increased 32 percent over the past decade.
(d) Over 11.4 million people in California have prediabetes, a condition that is a precursor to full onset type 2 diabetes. This suggests that the total population of those diagnosed will continue to rise in the absence of interventions.
(e) The prevalence of diagnosed gestational diabetes in California has increased 60 percent in just seven years, from 3.3 percent of hospital deliveries in 1998 to 5.3 percent of hospital deliveries in 2005, with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that the diagnosis rate could run as high as 18.3 percent.
(f) The fiscal impact to the State of California, including total health care and related costs for the treatment of diabetes, was over $35.9 billion in 2010.
(g) There is a disproportionate prevalence of type 2 diabetes among Californians who are Black, Hispanic, or of Asian origin compared to the general population. As of 2010, the incidence of diabetes among Black and Hispanic people was nearly double that among non-Hispanic Whites at approximately 14 percent. Asians and Pacific Islanders, in the aggregate, experience higher rates of diabetes than other populations. Certain groups within the Asian and Pacific Islander population experience the highest prevalence and risk overall, including Filipino, South Asians, and Pacific Islanders, who suffer from diabetes at rates of 15 percent, 16 percent, and more than 18 percent, respectively.
(h) A recent study of a large state with a sizable diabetes population found that the rate of diagnosed diabetes in that state’s Medicaid population is nearly double that of its general population.
(i) There is no cure for any type of diabetes; however, there is evidence that diabetes can be prevented or delayed in onset through lifestyle changes and medical intervention.
(j) Diabetes, when left untreated, can lead to serious and costly complications and a reduced lifespan.
(k) Many of these serious complications can be delayed or avoided with timely diagnosis, effective patient self-care, and improved social awareness.
(l) It is the intent of the Legislature to require the State Department of Public Health to provide to the Legislature information, including the annual federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention progress report, on diabetes prevention and management activities conducted by the State Department of Public Health and expenditures associated with diabetes prevention and management activities. These activities are set forth by the State Department of Public Health in the California Wellness Plan 2014 and the report dated September 2014 entitled “Burden of Diabetes in California.”
104251.
(a) The State Department of Public Health shall submit a report to the Legislature on or before January 1, 2019, that includes a summary and compilation of recommendations on diabetes prevention and management, if any, from all of the following sources:
(1) The University of California.
(2) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
(3) The California Wellness Plan.
(4) Other statewide diabetes stakeholder groups.
(5) Other entities identified by the department as having relevant findings and recommendations.

SECTION 1.
Section 69432.9 of the Education Code is amended to read:
69432.9.
(a) A Cal Grant applicant shall submit a complete official financial aid application pursuant to Section 69433 and applicable regulations adopted by the commission. Each pupil enrolled in grade 12 in a California public school, including a charter school, other than pupils who opt out as provided in subdivision (d), shall be deemed to be a Cal Grant applicant.
(b) Financial need shall be determined to establish an applicant’s initial eligibility for a Cal Grant award and a renewing recipient’s continued eligibility using the federal financial need methodology pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 69506 and applicable regulations adopted by the commission, and as established by Title IV of the federal Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. Secs. 1070 et seq.).
(1) “Expected family contribution,” with respect to an applicant or renewing recipient, shall be determined using the federal methodology pursuant to subdivision (a) of Section 69506 (as established by Title IV of the federal Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. Secs. 1070 et seq.)) and applicable rules and regulations adopted by the commission.
(2) “Financial need” means the difference between the student’s cost of attendance as determined by the commission and the expected family contribution. The calculation of financial need shall be consistent with Title IV of the federal Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (20 U.S.C. Secs. 1070 et seq.).
(3) (A) The minimum financial need required for receipt of an initial and renewal Cal Grant A or C award shall be no less than the maximum annual award value for the applicable institution, plus an additional one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) of financial need.
(B) The minimum financial need required for receipt of an initial and renewal Cal Grant B award shall be no less than seven hundred dollars ($700).
(c) (1) The commission shall require that a grade point average be submitted to it for all Cal Grant A and B applicants, except for those permitted to provide test scores in lieu of a grade point average.
(2) The commission shall require that a grade point average be submitted to it electronically on a standardized form for all grade 12 pupils at public schools, including charter schools, each academic year, except for pupils who have opted out as provided in subdivision (d). Social security numbers shall not be included in the information submitted to the commission. However, if the commission determines that a social security number is required to complete the application for financial aid, the school, school district, or charter school may obtain permission from the parent or guardian of the pupil, or the pupil, if he or she is 18 years of age, to submit the pupil’s social security number to the commission.
(3) The commission shall require that each report of a grade point average include a certification, executed under penalty of perjury, by a school official, that the grade point average reported is accurately reported. The certification shall include a statement that it is subject to review by the commission or its designee.
(4) The commission shall adopt regulations that establish a grace period for receipt of the grade point average and any appropriate corrections, and that set forth the circumstances under which a student may submit a specified test score designated by the commission, by regulation, in lieu of submitting a qualifying grade point average.
(5) It is the intent of the Legislature that high schools and institutions of higher education certify the grade point averages of their students in time to meet the application deadlines imposed by this chapter.
(6) It is the intent of the Legislature that the commission make available to each high school and school district a report identifying all grade 12 pupils within the high school or school district, respectively, who have and have not completed the Free Application for Federal Student Aid or the California Dream Act Application.
(d) (1) The school district or charter school shall, no later than October 15 of a pupil’s grade 12 academic year, notify, in writing, each grade 12 pupil and, for a pupil under 18 years of age, his or her parent or guardian that, pursuant to subdivision (a), the pupil will be deemed a Cal Grant applicant unless the pupil opts out within a period of time specified in the notice, which shall not be less than 30 days. The required notice shall indicate when the school will first send grade point averages to the commission. The school district or charter school shall provide an opportunity for the pupil to opt out of being automatically deemed a Cal Grant applicant.
(2) Until a pupil turns 18 years of age, only a parent or guardian may opt the pupil out. Once a pupil turns 18 years of age, only the pupil may opt himself or herself out and, if prior to the conclusion of the notice period, the pupil may opt in over the prior decision of a parent or guardian to opt out.

The Cal Grant Program establishes the Cal Grant A and B Entitlement awards, the California Community College Transfer Entitlement awards, the Competitive Cal Grant A and B awards, the Cal Grant C award, and the Cal Grant T award under the administration of the Student Aid Commission, and establishes eligibility requirements for awards under these programs for participating students attending qualifying institutions. As part of these eligibility requirements, existing law requires the commission to require that a grade point average be submitted to it electronically for all grade 12 pupils at public schools, including charter schools, each academic year, except as specified.
This bill would require this electronic submission to be on a standardized form. The bill would also authorize the commission to require that verification of high school graduation or its equivalent be electronically submitted for all former grade 12 pupils who graduated from public schools, including charter schools, in the prior academic year, except for pupils who have opted out, as specified. By requiring the electronic submission of grade point average information to be on a standardized form, and authorizing the commission to additionally require verification of graduation information of prior grade 12 pupils, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) The California Environmental Quality Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code) facilitates the maintenance of a quality environment for the people of the state through identification of significant effects on the environment caused by a proposed project, consideration of alternatives, and implementation of feasible mitigation measures to reduce those effects.
(2) The act is premised on transparency in decisionmaking through public dissemination of information about a proposed project’s effect on the environment.
(3) The act empowers the public to challenge a project in court for failure to fully comply with the act’s exhaustive disclosure and mitigation requirements.
(4) Various entities are increasingly using litigation pursuant to the act for competitive purposes to either frustrate a competitor’s project or to extract concessions from a project proponent.
(5) Despite the focus on transparency and public disclosure in the decisionmaking process, shadow groups funded by unknown backers often threaten and bring litigation challenging proposed projects without being required to disclose who is funding the litigation or what financial interests those entities have related to the proposed project.
(6) Project opponents sometimes strategically use litigation to delay a project past its point of economic viability, thereby using litigation to stop projects that could not otherwise be stopped during the decisionmaking process.
(7) California Rules of Court require the disclosure of entities that fund the preparation and submission of amicus briefs to the court.
(8) The state and public have a compelling interest in the disclosure of the identities of entities that fund litigation under the act so they can better understand the identities of those organizations participating in the public decisionmaking process, determine whether the petitioner or plaintiff may be suing for competitive or other nonenvironmental purposes, and protect scarce judicial resources by deterring entities from using lawsuits for competitive or other nonenvironmental purposes.
(9) The courts have a compelling interest in disclosure to determine whether the plaintiff or petitioner is seeking to advance environmental, nonenvironmental, or a mix of environmental and nonenvironmental interests in filing an action pursuant to the act.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to require plaintiffs and petitioners bringing an action pursuant to the act to disclose those persons or entities who make contributions to fund the preparation of the petition and subsequent actions or proceedings and any financial interests they may have related to the proposed project.
SEC. 2.
Section 21175 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
21175.
(a) In an action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul any act or decision of a public agency on the grounds of noncompliance with this division, the plaintiff or petitioner shall include an affidavit identifying every person or entity who made a monetary contribution of one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, or committed to contribute one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, for the preparation of the petition and subsequent action or proceeding.
(b) The plaintiff or petitioner shall have a continuing obligation throughout the course of the proceeding to identify any person or entity that has made a single or multiple contributions or commitments, the sum of which is $1,000 or more, and that were intended to fund the action or proceeding.
(c) The disclosures required pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) shall also include the identity of any pecuniary or business interest that the person or entity has related to the proposed project.
(d) A plaintiff or petitioner may request the court’s permission to withhold the public disclosure of a contributor. The court may grant the request if it finds that the public interest in keeping that information confidential clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure.
(e) A court may, upon its own motion or the motion of any party, take any action necessary to compel compliance with the requirements of this section, up to and including dismissal of the action or proceeding.
(f) An individual contributing funds to file an action or proceeding pursuant to this division in his or her individual capacity, and not as a representative for an organization or association, has the right to limit disclosure of his or her personal information to an in-camera review by the court.
(g) The information disclosed pursuant to this section may be used to enable a court to determine whether the financial burden of private enforcement supports the award of attorneys’ fees in actions or proceedings brought to enforce this division.

Section 21001.1 of the
Public Resources Code

The California Environmental Quality Act requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment, or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect.
Existing law declares the policy of the state that a project to be carried out by a public agency be subject to the same level of review and consideration under the act as that required of private projects required to be approved by public agencies.
The act authorizes specified entities to file and maintain with a court an action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul an act of a public agency on grounds of noncompliance with the requirements of the act.
This bill would make a technical, nonsubstantive change to those provisions.
This bill would require a plaintiff or petitioner, in an action brought pursuant to the act, to disclose the identity of a person or entity that contributes in excess of $1,000, as specified, toward the plaintiff’s or petitioner’s costs of the action. The bill also would require the plaintiff or petitioner to identify any pecuniary or business interest related to the project or issues involved in the action of any person or entity that contributes in excess of $1,000 to the costs of the action, as specified. The bill would provide that a failure to comply with these requirements may be grounds for dismissal of the action by the court.

Chapter 5.9 (commencing with Section 42360) is added to Part 3 of Division 30 of the Public Resources Code, to read:
CHAPTER  5.9. Plastic Microbeads Nuisance Prevention Law
42360.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Plastic does not biodegrade into elements or compounds commonly found in nature like other organic materials, but, instead, upon exposure to the elements photodegrades into smaller pieces of plastic causing land and water pollution that is virtually impossible to remediate.
(b) Plastic pollution is the dominant type of anthropogenic debris found throughout the marine environment.
(c) Plastic pollution is an environmental and human health hazard and a public nuisance.
(d) Microplastics that are five millimeters or less in diameter become bioavailable as soon as they enter the marine environment and are ingested by marine organisms.
(e) Microplastics are persistent organic compounds that attract other pollutants commonly present in the environment, many of which are recognized to have serious deleterious impacts on human health or the environment, including DDT, DDE, PCBs, and flame retardants.
(f) PAHs, PCBs, and PBDEs from plastic transfer to fish tissue when ingested and bioaccumulate.
(g) Fish that humans consume have been found to ingest microplastics, which are then ingested by the humans who consume these fish.
(h) Consumer personal care products such as facial scrubs, soaps, and toothpaste increasingly contain thousands of microplastics in the form of plastic microbeads that are flushed down drains or make their way into the environment by other means as part of their intended use.
(i) Plastic microbeads in personal care products are generally not recoverable through ordinary wastewater treatment and can be released into the environment.
(j) Plastic microbeads have been found in surface waters within the United States, as well as in fish, marine mammals, reptiles, mussels, and worms.
(k) There are economically feasible alternatives to plastic microbeads used in personal care products, as evidenced by the current use of biodegradable, natural, abrasive materials in personal care products such as beeswax, shells, nuts, seeds, and sand.
42361.
As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
(a) “Person” means an individual, business, or other entity.
(b) (1) “Personal care product” means an article intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced to, or otherwise applied to, the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance, and an article intended for use as a component of that type of article.
(2) “Personal care product” does not include a prescription drug, as defined in Section 110010.2 of the Health and Safety Code.
(c) “Plastic microbead” means an intentionally added solid plastic particle measuring five millimeters or less in every dimension.
42362.
On and after January 1, 2020, a person shall not sell or offer for promotional purposes in this state any personal care products containing plastic microbeads that are used to exfoliate or cleanse in a rinse-off product, including, but not limited to, toothpaste.
42363.
Section 42362 shall not apply to a person that sells or offers for promotional purposes a personal care product containing plastic microbeads in an amount less than 1 part per million (ppm) by weight.
42364.
(a) A person who violates or threatens to violate Section 42362 may be enjoined in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(b) (1) A person who has violated Section 42362 is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per day for each violation in addition to any other penalty established by law. That civil penalty may be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(2) In assessing the amount of a civil penalty for a violation of this chapter, the court shall consider all of the following:
(A) The nature and extent of the violation.
(B) The number of, and severity of, the violations.
(C) The economic effect of the penalty on the violator.
(D) Whether the violator took good faith measures to comply with this chapter and when these measures were taken.
(E) The deterrent effect that the imposition of the penalty would have on both the violator and the regulated community as a whole.
(F) Any other factor that justice may require.
(c) Actions pursuant to this section may be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the people of the state, by a district attorney, by a city attorney, or by a city prosecutor in a city or city and county having a full-time city prosecutor.
(d) Civil penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be paid to the office of the city attorney, city prosecutor, district attorney, or Attorney General, whichever office brought the action.
42366.
This chapter does not alter or diminish any legal obligation otherwise required in common law or by statute or regulation, and this chapter does not create or enlarge any defense in any action to enforce the legal obligation. Penalties and sanctions imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to any penalties or sanctions otherwise prescribed by law.

The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65) prohibits any person, in the course of doing business, from knowingly and intentionally exposing any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without giving a specified warning, or from discharging or releasing such a chemical into any source of drinking water, except as specified. Existing law prohibits the sale of expanded polystyrene packaging material by a wholesaler or manufacturer. Existing law prohibits a person from selling a plastic product in this state that is labeled with the term “compostable,” “home compostable,” or “marine degradable” unless, at the time of sale, the plastic product meets the applicable ASTM International standard specification.
This bill would prohibit, on and after January 1, 2020, a person, as defined, from selling or offering for promotional purposes in this state a personal care product containing plastic microbeads that are used to exfoliate or cleanse in a rinse-off product, as specified. The bill would exempt from those prohibitions the sale or promotional offer of a product containing less than 1 part per million (ppm) by weight of plastic microbeads.
The bill would make a violator liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500 per day for each violation. The bill would authorize the penalty to be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction by the Attorney General or local officials. The bill would require the civil penalties collected in an action brought pursuant to the act to be retained by the office that brought the action.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Voting, especially at the local level, is the cornerstone of democracy. However, voter turnout has declined consistently in recent decades. In the most recent general election conducted in November 2014, voter turnout was only 42 percent of eligible voters, representing a historic low.
(2) Research shows that early voting experiences are important determinants of future voting behavior. The formation of voting habits begins when individuals reach voting age and experience their first elections.
(3) Local political decisions have great influence on the lives of 16 and 17 year olds. As such, 16 and 17 year olds deserve to vote, and research shows they are mature enough to do so.
(4) Lowering the voting age for certain local elections will provide an opportunity to engage young voters on issues that directly affect them and will lead to increased voter turnout, thereby strengthening our democracy. As an example, Norway and Austria recently permitted 16 and 17 year olds to vote in certain elections and research shows that voter turnout for 16 and 17 year olds was much higher than older first-time voters.
(5) Lowering the voting age will also increase the demand for better civics education in schools, thereby significantly increasing political engagement.
(6) It is unclear whether existing state law permits charter cities to lower the voting age for local elections. Therefore, this bill seeks to provide legal certainty to those local governments considering this issue.
(b) Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that:
(1) Charter cities and charter cities and counties be permitted, and not required, to authorize 16 year olds to vote in school district governing board elections as a means of increasing voter turnout and civil participation.
(2) This section does not create a state-mandated local program because any costs imposed by this act shall be paid for by the charter city or charter city and county or the school district.

(c) Pursuant to Section 9255, the governing body of a city or city and county may amend its charter to authorize a person who will be at least 16 years of age at the time of the next election to vote in a school district governing board election in which he or she would be qualified to vote based on residence. This subdivision only applies to elections for school district governing boards that are governed by a charter pursuant to Article 1 (commencing with Section 5200) of Chapter 2 of Part 4 of Division 1 of Title 1 of the Education Code.
(1) The city or city and county shall prescribe the manner and method by which votes may be cast and counted pursuant to this subdivision, provided that all votes are cast no later than 8 p.m. on the day of the election.
(2) If a city or city and county amends its charter as described in this subdivision, it shall enter into an agreement with the county elections official providing for payment by the city, city or county, or school district of all costs necessary to implement the charter amendment. Alternatively, the agreement may provide that the city, city or county, or school district shall perform any or all duties necessary to implement the charter amendment, unless prohibited by law. The agreement need not be entered into before the enactment of the charter amendment described in this subdivision.
(3) A charter amendment adopted pursuant to this subdivision with an effective date on or after January 1, 2017, is valid regardless of the date the charter amendment was approved.

(c) Pursuant to Section 2102, any person who is at least 16 years of age and otherwise meets all eligibility requirements to vote is eligible to preregister to vote, but is not eligible to vote until he or she is 18 years of age, except as provided in subdivision (d).
(d) Pursuant to Section 9255, the governing body of a city or city and county may amend its charter to authorize a person who will be at least 16 years of age at the time of the next election to vote in a school district governing board election in which he or she would be qualified to vote based on residence.

Existing law requires a person to be at least 18 years of age at the time of the next election, among other qualifications, to be eligible to register and vote.
Existing law provides for the amendment of a city or city and county charter, and requires a charter amendment proposed by a charter commission for a city or city and county to be submitted to the voters at an established statewide general, statewide primary, or regularly scheduled municipal election, as specified.
This bill would authorize a city or city and county to propose an amendment to its charter that would allow a person who is at least 16 years of age at the time of the next election to vote in a school district governing board election, as specified, in which he or she would be qualified to vote based on residence. The bill would, in the event that a city or city and county amends its charter as described, authorize a person who is at least 16 years of age at the time of the next election, and who is otherwise qualified, to register to vote for the limited purpose of voting in a school district governing board election. If a city or city and county amends its charter as described above, this bill would require the city or city and county to enter into an agreement, as specified, with the county elections official providing for payment by the city, city or county, or school district of all costs necessary to implement the charter amendment or, alternatively, require that the city, city or county, or school district perform any or all duties necessary to implement the charter amendment, unless prohibited by law.
The bill would further provide that a charter amendment adopted pursuant to these provisions with an effective date on or after January 1, 2017, is valid regardless of the date the charter amendment was approved.
This bill would provide that specified provisions shall become operative only if the Secretary of State certifies that the state has a statewide voter registration database that complies with the requirements of the federal Help America Vote Act of 2002 (52 U.S.C. Sec. 20901 et seq.).

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) In 2012, about 35,000 children were born to 15- to 19-year-olds in California. Nationwide, 70 percent of young parents are pushed out of school, and fewer than 4 in 10 young mothers graduate from high school by 18 years of age.
(b) Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.) and California law protect all pupils’ rights to equal educational opportunities regardless of sex. Yet, only some of California’s school districts provide pregnant and parenting pupil programs.
(c) Pregnant and parenting pupils face overwhelming, system-enforced obstacles to graduating and receiving an education of equal quality to that of their peers that vary across school districts and include all of the following:
(1) Inconsistent access to excused “family leave” absences to care for new infants during the critical period of early child development, with male parents often having no access.
(2) Involuntary pushout due to high absence rates related to pregnancy and parenting responsibilities.
(3) Rigid requirements to verify excused absences to care for a sick child.
(4) Allowed “reasonable” amount of time to make up work is defined by the school districts and not to the individual circumstances or to support a pupil’s goal to graduate.
(5) Varying levels of support and engagement from schools while pupils are absent.
(6) Encouragement to pursue independent study that may not fulfill the “A-G” admission requirements for the California State University and the University of California or have inconsistent and rigorous attendance policies.
(7) Parenting pupils’ lack of awareness of their rights under Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.) and California law, as well as pupils’ different educational options during pregnancy, postpartum, and as a parent.
(d) While California has an 80 percent high school graduation rate, only 38 percent of young moms who have a child before they are 18 years of age graduate from high school, 19 percent get a General Education Development (GED) credential, and only 2 percent go to college before 30 years of age.
(e) Educational challenges set the stage for economic hardship: The median income for women over 25 years of age without a high school degree is $15,021, less than 53 percent of that of their peers’ median income of $31,904.
(f) Nearly 60 percent of mothers under 19 years of age live in poverty.
(g) Children of teen mothers tend to struggle more in school, are less likely to complete high school, have lower performance on standardized tests, and are more likely to enter the foster care system and become teen parents themselves.
(h) Studies show that pregnancy can motivate pupils to complete school and pursue postsecondary education.
(i) Further, bonding time is critical for an infant’s long-term development and the well-being of parents. California has acknowledged the importance of bonding time and paved the way in supporting bonding within working families.
(j) Since 2004, workers have been entitled to up to six weeks of family leave to bond with their children. Working families benefit significantly from bonding time. Parenting pupils and their infants, some of our most vulnerable citizens, should not have to choose between their family and education.
SEC. 2.
Section 222.5 is added to the Education Code, to read:
222.5.
A school district shall notify pregnant and parenting pupils of their rights and options available pursuant to Title IX of the federal Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1681 et seq.) and Sections 222, 46015, and 48206.3 through annual school year welcome packets pursuant to Section 48980, through independent study packets, on the school district’s Internet Web site, in lactation rooms, and in locker rooms.
SEC. 3.
Section 46015 is added to the Education Code, to read:
46015.
(a) The governing board of a school district may
allow
adopt a policy that allows
a parenting pupil who gives or expects to give birth up to six weeks of parental leave and may allow a parenting pupil not giving birth up to three weeks of parental leave after the birth. The length of leave shall be determined by the pupil and shall not exceed the length of time allowed by this subdivision.
(b) (1) Absences allowed pursuant to this section shall not be deemed absences in computing average daily attendance pursuant to Section 42238.5 if the governing board of the school district of attendance files an expectant and parenting pupil policy, including procedures for ensuring pupils are provided with schoolwork while on parental leave, with the department.
(2) For purposes of calculating average daily attendance for a pupil on parental leave, one day of attendance shall be credited for each hour spent on activities related to the instruction of that pupil, with a maximum equivalent of the limits specified in subdivision (a). For purposes of this paragraph, “activities related to the instruction of that pupil” means activities that require contact with the pupil.
(3) An expectant and parenting pupil policy shall require a pupil to submit a parental leave request form, similar or the same as request forms used to request temporary disability time off, to the pupil’s school before the end of the pregnant pupil’s second trimester. A school shall process a request within five business days and provide makeup work plan development process guidelines to a pupil in conjunction with the positive determination of parental leave.
SEC. 4.
Section 48205 of the Education Code is amended to read:
48205.
(a) Notwithstanding Section 48200, a pupil shall be excused from school when the absence is:
(1) Due to his or her illness.
(2) Due to quarantine under the direction of a county or city health officer.
(3) For the purpose of having medical, dental, optometrical, or chiropractic services rendered.
(4) For the purpose of attending the funeral services of a member of his or her immediate family, so long as the absence is not more than one day if the service is conducted in California and not more than three days if the service is conducted outside California.
(5) For the purpose of jury duty in the manner provided for by law.
(6) Due to the illness or medical appointment during school hours of a child of whom the pupil is the custodial parent, including up to four absences per school year to care for a sick child, for which the school shall not require a note from a doctor.
(7) For justifiable personal reasons, including, but not limited to, an appearance in court, attendance at a funeral service, observance of a holiday or ceremony of his or her religion, attendance at religious retreats, attendance at an employment conference, or attendance at an educational conference on the legislative or judicial process offered by a nonprofit organization when the pupil’s absence is requested in writing by the parent or guardian and approved by the principal or a designated representative pursuant to uniform standards established by the governing board.
(8) For the purpose of serving as a member of a precinct board for an election pursuant to Section 12302 of the Elections Code.
(9) For the purpose of spending time with a member of the pupil’s immediate family, who is an active duty member of the uniformed services, as defined in Section 49701, and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or has immediately returned from, deployment to a combat zone or combat support position. Absences granted pursuant to this paragraph shall be granted for a period of time to be determined at the discretion of the superintendent of the school district.
(b) A pupil absent from school under this section shall be allowed to complete all assignments and tests missed during the absence that can be reasonably provided and, upon satisfactory completion within a reasonable period of time, shall be given full credit therefor. The teacher of the class from which a pupil is absent shall determine which tests and assignments shall be reasonably equivalent to, but not necessarily identical to, the tests and assignments that the pupil missed during the absence.
(c) For purposes of this section, attendance at religious retreats shall not exceed four hours per semester.
(d) Absences pursuant to this section are deemed to be absences in computing average daily attendance and shall not generate state apportionment payments.
(e) “Immediate family,” as used in this section, has the same meaning as set forth in Section 45194, except that references therein to “employee” shall be deemed to be references to “pupil.”
SEC. 5.
Section 48206.3 of the Education Code is amended to read:
48206.3.
(a) Except for those pupils receiving individual instruction provided pursuant to Section 48206.5, a pupil with a temporary disability that makes attendance in the regular day classes or alternative education program in which the pupil is enrolled impossible or inadvisable shall receive individual instruction provided by the district in which the pupil is deemed to reside.
(b) For purposes of this section and Sections 48206.5, 48207, and 48208, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) “Individual instruction” means instruction provided to an individual pupil in the pupil’s home, in a hospital or other residential health facility, excluding state hospitals, or under other circumstances prescribed by regulations adopted for that purpose by the state board.
(2) “Temporary disability” means a physical, mental, or emotional disability incurred while a pupil is enrolled in regular day classes or an alternative education program, and after which the pupil can reasonably be expected to return to regular day classes or the alternative education program without special intervention. Temporary disability also includes pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery therefrom. A temporary disability shall not include a disability for which a pupil is identified as an individual with exceptional needs pursuant to Section 56026.
(c) (1) For purposes of computing average daily attendance pursuant to Section 42238.5, each clock hour of teaching time devoted to individual instruction shall count as one day of attendance.
(2) A pupil shall not be credited with more than five days of attendance per calendar week, or more than the total number of calendar days that regular classes are maintained by the district in any fiscal year.
(d) Notice of the availability of individualized instruction shall be given pursuant to Section 48980.
SEC. 6.
Section 48208 of the Education Code is amended to read:

(b) Upon receipt of notification pursuant to subdivision (a), a school district shall do all of the following:
(1) (A) Within five working days of receipt of the notification, determine whether the pupil will be able to receive individualized instruction, and, if the determination is positive, when the individualized instruction may commence. Individualized instruction shall commence no later than five working days after the positive determination has been rendered.
(B) A school district shall provide a pupil with a temporary disability as a result of pregnancy with guidelines for makeup work plan development if the option for individualized instruction is not available at the pupil’s school or school district.
(2) Provide the pupil with individualized instruction pursuant to Section 48206.3. The school district may enter into an agreement with the school district in which the pupil previously attended regular day classes or an alternative education program, to have the school district the pupil previously attended provide the pupil with individualized instruction pursuant to Section 48206.3.
(3) Within five working days of the commencement of individualized instruction, provide the school district in which the pupil previously attended regular day classes or an alternative education program with written notice that the pupil shall not be counted by that school district for purposes of computing average daily attendance pursuant to Section 42238.5, effective the date on which individualized instruction commenced.
SEC. 7.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.

Actual Output
(1) Existing law requires a pupil to be excused from school for specified types of absences and prohibits those excused absences from generating state apportionment payments by deeming them as absences in computing average daily attendance.
This bill would include as another type of excused absence, 4 absences per school year to care for a sick child, for which the school is prohibited from requiring a note from a doctor. The bill would authorize the governing board of a school district to
allow
adopt a policy that allows
a parenting pupil who gives or expects to give birth up to 6 weeks of parental leave and to allow a parenting pupil not giving birth up to 3 weeks of parental leave. The bill would specify that parental leave absences shall not be deemed absences in computing average daily attendance if the governing board of the school district of attendance files with the State Department of Education an expectant and parenting pupil policy that includes procedures for ensuring pupils are provided with schoolwork while on parental leave, and would specify the method for crediting average daily attendance for these pupils.
(2) Existing state regulations require an educational institution to treat pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, termination of pregnancy, and recovery from those conditions in the same manner and under the same policies as any other temporary disability. Existing law requires a school district that receives notification of a pupil’s temporary disability to determine whether the pupil will be able to receive individualized instruction, and, if the determination is positive, to provide the individualized instruction, as specified.
This bill would require a school district to provide a pupil with a temporary disability as a result of pregnancy with guidelines for makeup work plan development if the option for individualized instruction is not available at the pupil’s school or school district.
(3) Existing law prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, gender, or other specified characteristics in any program or activity conducted by an educational institution that receives, or benefits from, state financial assistance or enrolls pupils who receive state financial aid.
This bill would require a school district to notify pregnant and parenting pupils of specified rights and options available to those pupils, as specified.
(4) To the extent that this bill would impose additional duties on school districts, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
(5) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires a lead agency, as defined, to prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion of an environmental impact report on a project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may have a significant effect on the environment or to adopt a negative declaration if it finds that the project will not have that effect.
Existing law, until January 1, 2017, exempts from CEQA the design, site acquisition, construction, operation, or maintenance of certain structures and equipment of the Los Angeles Regional Interoperable Communications System (LA-RICS) consisting of a long-term evolution broadband mobile data system and a land mobile radio system, if certain criteria are met at the individual project site, including that the site contains either an antenna support structure, as provided, or a public facility that transmits or receives public safety radio signals.
This bill would extend that exemption until January 1, 2020, and would specify that a fire station is not a public facility for purposes of determining if that exemption applies to an individual project site. The bill would provide that the exemption does not apply if the project site is located in certain areas. The bill would require the LA-RICS Joint Powers Authority to hold a public meeting before making a determination that a project is exempted, to file the notice of exemption with the Office of Planning and Research and the county clerk in the county in which the project is located, and to post certain information on its Internet Web site. Because a lead agency, which may include a local agency, would be required to determine whether a project qualifies for this exemption and to perform additional duties, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

If the limited liability company fails to timely file the agreements on behalf of each of its nonresident members, then the limited liability company shall, at the time set forth in subdivision (f), pay to this state on behalf of each nonresident member of whom an agreement has not been timely filed an amount equal to the highest marginal tax rate in effect under Section 17041, in the case of members that are individuals, estates, or trusts, and Section 23151, in the case of members that are corporations, multiplied by the amount of the member’s distributive share of the income source to the state reflected on the limited liability company’s return for the taxable period, reduced by the amount of tax previously withheld and paid by the limited liability company pursuant to Section 18662 and the regulations thereunder with respect to each nonresident member.

The Personal Income Tax Law requires a partnership to file an informational return on the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of its taxable year, and a limited liability company classified as a partnership to file a return of the taxes due and payable on the 15th day of the 4th month following the close of its taxable year. The Corporation Tax Law requires a taxpayer subject to that law, including an “S corporation,” to file a return on the 15th day of the 3rd month following the close of its taxable year. These tax return due dates conform to federal income tax return due dates for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2016.
This bill would require, instead, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a partnership and a limited liability company classified as a partnership to file a return on the 15th day of the 3rd month, and a taxpayer subject to the Corporation Tax Law, but not an “S corporation,” to file a return on the 15th day of the 4th month, following the close of its taxable year. These tax return due dates would conform to federal income tax return due dates for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

Existing law generally regulates formation and enforcement of contracts, including what constitutes an unlawful contract. Under existing law, a contract is unlawful if it is contrary to an express provision of law, contrary to the policy of express law, though not expressly prohibited, or otherwise contrary to good morals.
Existing law authorizes a county board of supervisors on behalf of its sheriff, and a legislative body of a city on behalf of its chief of police, to contract to provide supplemental law enforcement services to private individuals, private entities, and private corporations in specified circumstances and subject to certain conditions.
This bill would, commencing on January 1, 2018, prohibit a city, county, or a city and county, or a local law enforcement agency from entering into or renewing a contract, or modifying a contract to extend the length of the contract, with a private corporation, contractor, or vendor to detain immigrants in civil immigration proceedings for profit.

The Personal Income Tax Law allows various credits against the taxes imposed by that law, including certain credits that are allowed in modified conformity to credits allowed by federal income tax laws. Federal income tax laws allow a refundable earned income tax credit for certain low-income individuals who have earned income from wages, salaries, tips, and other employee compensation plus net earnings from self-employment and who meet certain other requirements. The Personal Income Tax Law, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, in modified conformity with federal income tax laws, allows an earned income credit against personal income tax, which is only for earned income from wages, salaries, tips, and other employee compensation, and a payment in excess of that credit amount, to an eligible individual that is equal to that portion of the earned income tax credit allowed by federal law as determined by the earned income tax credit adjustment factor as set forth in the annual Budget Act.
This bill would, for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016, expand the earned income credit allowed by the Personal Income Tax Law by providing additional conformity with federal income tax law to include specified net earnings from self-employment in earned income thus allowing an earned income credit for taxpayers for those earnings.
Existing law establishes the continuously appropriated Tax Relief and Refund Account and provides that payments required to be made to taxpayers or other persons from the Personal Income Tax Fund are to be paid from that account, including any amount allowable as an earned income credit in excess of any tax liabilities.
By authorizing new payments from that account for additional amounts in excess of personal income tax liabilities, this bill would make an appropriation.
Existing law imposes an annual minimum franchise tax, except as provided, on every corporation incorporated in this state, qualified to transact intrastate business in this state, or doing business in this state. Existing law, until taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, exempts a corporation and a limited liability company that are small businesses solely owned by a deployed member of the United States Armed Forces, as specified, from paying the minimum franchise tax, or the annual tax, for the privilege of doing business in this state if the corporation or limited liability company ceases operation or operates at a loss, as defined.
The bill would reduce the annual minimum franchise tax to $150 for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, for specified corporations. This bill would also extend the exemption for corporations and limited liability companies solely owned by deployed members of the United States Armed Forces until January 1, 2020.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.

Existing law provides for the Medi-Cal program, which is administered by the State Department of Health Care Services, under which qualified low-income individuals receive health care services. The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid Program provisions. One method by which these services are provided is pursuant to contracts with various types of managed care health plans, including through a county organized health system.
Existing law, the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (Knox-Keene), provides for the licensure and regulation of health care service plans by the Department of Managed Health Care and makes a willful violation of the act a crime.
Existing law provides the California Medical Assistance Commission with the authority to negotiate exclusive contracts with county organized health systems to provide health care services under the Medi-Cal program. Under existing law, the contracting counties are exempt from Knox-Keene for purposes of carrying out those contracts.
This bill would repeal that exemption and
deleted
delete
related exemptions, deem a county contracting with the department under the provisions described above to be a health care service
plan,
plan as of specified dates,
and subject contracting counties to the act for purposes of carrying out those contracts, unless the act expressly provides otherwise. The bill would make conforming changes.
Because a willful violation of Knox-Keene is a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

SECTION 1.
Section 6253 of the Government Code is amended to read:
6253.
(a) Public records are open to inspection at all times during the office hours of the state or local agency and every person has a right to inspect any public record, except as hereafter provided. Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be available for inspection by any person requesting the record after deletion of the portions that are exempted by law.
(b) Except with respect to public records exempt from disclosure by express provisions of law, each state or local agency, upon a request for a copy of records that reasonably describes an identifiable record or records, shall make the records promptly available to any person upon payment of fees covering direct costs of duplication, or a statutory fee if applicable. Upon request, an exact copy shall be provided unless impracticable to do so.
(c) Each agency, upon a request for a copy of records, shall, within 10 days from receipt of the request, determine whether the request, in whole or in part, seeks copies of disclosable public records in the possession of the agency and shall promptly notify the person making the request of the determination and the reasons therefor. In unusual circumstances, the time limit prescribed in this section may be extended by written notice by the head of the agency or his or her designee to the person making the request, setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than 14 days. When the agency dispatches the determination, and if the agency determines that the request seeks disclosable public records, the agency shall state the estimated date and time when the records will be made available. As used in this section, “unusual circumstances” means the following, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request:
(1) The need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request.
(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are demanded in a single request.
(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject matter interest therein.
(4) The need to compile data, to write programming language or a computer program, or to construct a computer report to extract data.
(d) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to permit an agency to delay or obstruct the inspection or copying of public records. The notification of denial of any request for records required by Section 6255 shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial.
(e) Except as otherwise prohibited by law, a state or local agency may adopt requirements for itself that allow for faster, more efficient, or greater access to records than prescribed by the minimum standards set forth in this chapter.
(f) In addition to maintaining public records for public inspection during the office hours of the public agency, a public agency may comply with subdivision (a) by posting any public record on its Internet Web site and, in response to a request for a public record posted on the Internet Web site, directing a member of the public to the location on the Internet Web site where the public record is posted. However, if after the public agency directs a member of the public to the Internet Web site, the member of the public requesting the public record requests a copy of the public record due to an inability to access or reproduce the public record from the Internet Web site, the public agency shall promptly provide a copy of the public record pursuant to subdivision (b).
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which amends Section 6253 of the Government Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
The state has a very strong interest in ensuring both the transparency of, and efficient use of limited resources by, public agencies. In order to protect this interest, it is necessary to allow public agencies that have already increased the public’s access to public records by posting public records on the public agencies’ Internet Web sites to refer requests for posted public records to these Internet Web sites.
SEC. 3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which amends Section 6253 of the Government Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies. Pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the Legislature makes the following findings:
Since this act would authorize local agencies to make disclosures of public records by posting the public records on their Internet Web sites, thus making public record disclosures by local agencies more quickly and cost effectively, this act furthers the purpose of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.

(1) The California Public Records Act requires a public agency, defined to mean any state or local agency, to make its public records available for public inspection and to make copies available upon request and payment of a fee, unless the public records are exempt from disclosure. The act prohibits limitations on access to a public record based upon the purpose for which the public record is being requested if the public record is otherwise subject to disclosure, authorizes public agencies to adopt requirements that allow for faster, more efficient, or greater access to public records, and requires local agencies, except school districts, that voluntarily post public records on an open data Internet Resource, as defined, to post those public records in an open format that meets specified criteria.
This bill would authorize a public agency that posts a public record on its Internet Web site to refer a member of the public that requests to inspect the public record to the public agency’s Internet Web site where the public record is posted. This bill would require, if a member of the public requests a copy of the public record due to an inability to access or reproduce the public record from the Internet Web site where the public record is posted, the public agency to promptly provide a copy of the public record to the member of the public, as specified.
(2)  Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.
(3)The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings and contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Chapter 2.97 (commencing with Section 1001.100) is added to Title 6 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, to read:
CHAPTER  2.97. Veterans Courts
1001.100.
(a) Except as provided in Section 1001.101, each superior court shall develop and implement a veterans court.
(b) A veterans court established pursuant to this chapter shall accomplish all of the following objectives:
(1) Increase cooperation between the courts, criminal justice, veterans, and substance abuse systems.
(2) Create a dedicated calendar or a locally developed collaborative court-supervised veterans mental health program or system that contains the characteristics set out in subdivision (c) that will lead to placement of as many mentally ill offenders who are veterans of the United States military, including those with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, substance abuse, or any mental health problem stemming from United States military service, in community treatment, as is feasible and consistent with public safety.
(3) Improve access to necessary services and support.
(4) Reduce recidivism.
(5) Reduce the involvement of veterans in the criminal justice system and time in jail by making mental health service for veterans available in the least restrictive environment possible while promoting public safety.
(c) A veterans court established pursuant to this chapter shall have all of the following characteristics:
(1) Leadership by a superior court judicial officer assigned by the presiding judge.
(2) Enhanced accountability by combining judicial supervision with rehabilitation services that are rigorously monitored and focused on recovery.
(3) A problem solving focus.
(4) A team approach to decisionmaking, including, but not limited to, involving the defendant who is a veteran in the creation of a treatment plan and goals.
(5) Integration of social and treatment services.
(6) Judicial supervision of the treatment process, as appropriate.
(7) Community outreach efforts.
(8) Direct interaction between defendant and judicial officer.
(d) (1) The county and court stakeholders shall utilize a collaborative process to develop a plan for a veterans court that satisfies the requirements of this section.
(2) At least one stakeholder shall be a criminal justice client who is a veteran who has lived with the experience of mental illness as described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b).
(3) The plan shall incorporate as many of the following components as feasible:
(A) The method by which the veterans court ensures that the target population of defendants are identified and referred to the veterans court.
(B) The method for assessing defendants who are veterans for serious mental illness and co-occurring disorders.
(C) Eligibility criteria specifying what factors make the defendant eligible to participate in the veterans court, including service in the United States military, the amenability of the defendant to treatment and the facts of the case, as well as prior criminal history, United States military service history, and mental health and substance abuse treatment history.
(D) The elements of the treatment and supervision programs.
(E) Standards for continuing participation in, and successful completion of, the veterans court program.
(F) The need for all service providers and stakeholders to receive initial and ongoing training from county departments and community stakeholders with specialized knowledge about veterans’ treatment and service needs, such as the county health department, county veterans officers, county drug and alcohol department, and Veterans Administration partners, and the need to provide initial and ongoing training for designated staff on the nature of serious mental illness and on the treatment and supportive services available in the community.
(G) The process to ensure defendants will receive the appropriate level of treatment services with emphasis on maximizing federally funded services from the Veterans Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as the county and other local mental health and substance abuse treatment services to the extent that resources are available for that purpose, as described in paragraph (5) of subdivision (b) of Section 5600.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(H) The process for developing or modifying a treatment plan for each defendant, based on a formal assessment of the defendant’s mental health, United States military service history, and substance abuse treatment needs. Participation in the veterans court shall require defendants to complete the recommended treatment plan, and comply with any other terms and conditions that optimizes the likelihood that the defendant completes the program.
(I) The process for referring cases to the veterans court.
(J) A defendant’s voluntary entry into the veterans court, the right of a defendant to withdraw from the veterans court, and the process for explaining these rights to the defendant.
(e) (1) A veterans court shall be administered by a veterans court team led by a judicial officer to preside over the court.
(2) Other members of the veterans court team shall, to the extent feasible, include, but not be limited to, a prosecutor, a public defender, a county mental health liaison, a substance abuse liaison, a county veterans’ service officer, a probation officer, and a Veterans Administration social worker to assist the court with screening veterans court candidates for eligibility and suitability in Veterans Administration funded programs.
(3) The veterans court team shall determine the frequency of ongoing reviews of the progress of the offender in community treatment in order to ensure the offender adheres to the treatment plan as recommended, remains in treatment, and completes treatment.
(f) For the purposes of this section, it is the intent of the Legislature to do all of the following:
(1) Reduce costs to the state through decreased recidivism in a manner consistent with 2011 Realignment.
(2) Provide a veterans court judge a variety of options for carrying out the goal to ensure long-term public safety by maximizing the opportunities for veterans with psychological war wounds to get timely and appropriate treatment.
(3) Ensure that a veterans court judge exercises discretion and uses all tools available to ensure public safety and assist defendants to successfully complete appropriate treatment for the problems underlying their offenses.
(4) Augment, rather than replace, other sections within this code.
(5) Ensure a holistic approach that the priority underlying offense is treated and that offense-specific education and counseling aims are met. Where there are statutory requirements for certain education or counseling programs to be included in the terms of probation, for example, first conviction programs for driving under the influence offenders under Section 23152 of the Vehicle Code or domestic violence offenders under Section 273.5 of the Penal Code, it is the intent of the Legislature that the components of those offense-specific counseling terms be incorporated into the treatment programs that are designed to treat the underlying psychological disorders rather than required in lieu of the psychological treatments.
1001.101.
In order to satisfy the requirements of Section 1001.100, a superior court may partner with another superior court in the same county or a superior court in a neighboring county to provide access to a veterans court if that veterans court satisfies the requirements of Section 1001.100.
SEC. 2.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.

Existing law provides for the diversion of specified criminal offenders in alternate sentencing and treatment programs. Existing law authorizes the court, with the consent of the defendant and a waiver of the defendant’s speedy trial right, to postpone prosecution, either temporarily or permanently, of a misdemeanor and place the defendant in a pretrial diversion program, if the defendant was, or currently is, a member of the United States military and if he or she may be suffering from sexual trauma, traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or mental health problems as a result of his or her military service.
This bill would require superior courts to develop and implement veterans courts for eligible veterans of the United States military with the objective of, among other things, creation of a dedicated calendar or a locally developed collaborative court-supervised veterans mental health program or system that leads to the placement of as many mentally ill offenders who are veterans of the United States military, including those with post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, substance abuse, or any mental health problem stemming from military service, in community treatment as is feasible and consistent with public safety. The bill would make a related statement of legislative intent.
This bill would require a county and court stakeholders to utilize a collaborative process to develop a plan for a veterans court that satisfies the bill’s requirements. The bill would require a veterans court to be administered by a veterans court team led by a judicial officer to preside over the court, and would require that other members of the veterans court team, to the extent feasible, include, but not be limited to, a prosecutor, a public defender, a county mental health liaison, a substance abuse liaison, a county veterans’ service officer, a probation officer, and a Veterans Administration social worker to assist the court with screening veterans court candidates for eligibility and suitability in Veterans Administration funded programs. The bill would require the veterans court team to determine the frequency of ongoing reviews of the progress of the offender in community treatment in order to ensure the offender adheres to the treatment plan as recommended, remains in treatment, and completes treatment. By increasing the duties of local officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The bill would authorize a superior court, in order to satisfy the bill’s requirements, to partner with another superior court in the same county or a superior court in a neighboring county to provide access to a veterans court if that veterans court satisfies the bill’s requirements.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

CHAPTER  5.9. Plastic Microbeads Nuisance Prevention Law
42360.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(e) Some synthetic plastic microbeads are not recoverable through wastewater treatment facilities in the state and may be released into the environment.
(f) Synthetic plastic microbeads have been found in surface waters within the United States, as well as in fish, marine mammals, and reptiles, and in the digestive and circulatory systems of mussels and worms.
(g) There are economically feasible alternatives to synthetic plastic microbeads used in personal care products, as evidenced by the current use of biodegradable, natural, abrasive materials in personal care products such as beeswax, shells, nuts, and seeds.
42361.
As used in this chapter, the following terms have the following meanings:
(a) “Person” means an individual, business, or other entity.

(b) (1) A person who has violated Section 42362 is liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) per day for each violation in addition to any other penalty established by law. That civil penalty may be assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in any court of competent jurisdiction.
(2) In assessing the amount of a civil penalty for a violation of this chapter, the court shall consider all of the following:
(A) The nature and extent of the violation.
(B) The number of, and severity of, the violations.
(C) The economic effect of the penalty on the violator.
(D) Whether the violator took good faith measures to comply with this chapter and when these measures were taken.
(E) The deterrent effect that the imposition of the penalty would have on both the violator and the regulated community as a whole.
(F) Any other factor that justice may require.
(c) Actions pursuant to this section may be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the people of the state.
(d) Civil penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be paid to the office of the Attorney General and are available to that office, upon appropriation by the Legislature, for the purpose of enforcing this chapter.
42365.
This chapter does not alter or diminish any legal obligation otherwise required in common law or by statute or regulation, and this chapter does not create or enlarge any defense in any action to enforce the legal obligation. Penalties and sanctions imposed pursuant to this chapter shall be in addition to any penalties or sanctions otherwise prescribed by law.
42366.
Commencing January 1, 2016, a city, county, or other local public agency shall not adopt, amend, enforce, or otherwise implement, a local ordinance, resolution, regulation, or rule relating to the sale or offering for promotional purposes of personal care products that contain synthetic plastic microbeads.

(1) Existing law establishes a system of public elementary and secondary schools in this state, and authorizes local educational agencies throughout the state to operate schools and provide instruction to pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive. Existing law prescribes the course of study a pupil is required to complete while in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation from high school. These requirements include the completion of 3 courses in social studies, including one-year courses in United States history and geography and world history, culture, and geography, and one-semester courses in American government and economics.
This bill would express legislative findings and declarations relating to service learning. The bill would additionally require, commencing with the high school class graduating during the 2020–21 school year, and for the high school classes graduating in each subsequent school year, at least one of the
social studies classes
courses
completed by a pupil to satisfy the graduation requirements referenced above to have a service learning component.
The bill would define “service learning” for this purpose.
The bill would require the Superintendent of Public Instruction to develop curriculum standards for
social studies
courses that incorporate a service learning component in order to satisfy the requirements of this bill. The bill would require the Superintendent to consult with leaders of community organizations, pupils, parents, classroom teachers, school administrators, postsecondary educators, representatives of business and industry, and other persons with knowledge or experience the Superintendent deems appropriate to the task of developing these curriculum standards. The bill would require the Superintendent to submit these proposed curriculum standards to the State Board of Education on or before
July 1, 2016,
March 1, 2017,
and for the state board to adopt
or reject
curriculum standards that incorporate a service learning component into
social studies
courses on or before
January
July
1, 2017.
The
If the state board adopts these proposed curriculum standards, the
bill would require
these
the
curriculum standards to be implemented by school districts, commencing with the 2017–18 school year, as a component of
social studies
courses in order to satisfy the graduation requirements enacted by this bill. To the extent the implementation of these curriculum standards would impose new duties on school districts, this bill would constitute a state-mandated local program.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Part 40.2 (commencing with Section 67430) is added to Division 5 of Title 3 of the Education Code, to read:
PART 40.2. THE CALIFORNIA PROMISE
67430.
This part shall be known, and may be cited, as the California Promise.
67431.
For purposes of this part, the following terms have the following meanings:
(a) “Academic year of the student’s first year of enrollment” means the first full academic year in which a person is a student at the California State University.
(b) “Campus” means a campus within the California State University system as set forth in Section 89001.
(c) “Transfer student” is a student who earned an associate degree for transfer from a California community college.
(d) “Trustees” means the Trustees of the California State University.
67432.
The California Promise is hereby established to support California State University students in earning a baccalaureate degree within four academic years of the student’s first year of enrollment or, for transfer students within two academic years of the student’s first year of enrollment to the campus.
67433.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) A more concerted, statewide effort to create pathways to four-year graduation is needed at the California State University. For the 2010 cohort of full-time, first-time students at the California State University, 19 percent graduated within four academic years. According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, the most recent nationally comparable data shows that the California State University’s overall four-year graduation rate was 16 percent in 2011, below the national rate of 26 percent among similar public institutions.
(b) Impediments students face in graduating within four academic years include the inability to complete sufficient units per academic year or take courses that are part of their degree programs.
(c) New approaches are critical for the future of higher education in California. Efforts have been ongoing, though sporadic, to improve postsecondary educational institution enrollment and graduation. These efforts will need to be intensified and made more broadly systemic.
(d) Students who graduate within four academic years save tens of thousands of dollars. In addition to the direct costs of extended college and university enrollment, students miss out on earnings in the workforce while they remain in school.
(e) According to the Public Policy Institute of California, if bold measures are not taken, California will fall short of the state’s economic demand by 1.1 million college and university graduates by 2030. An increased demand for highly educated workers will outweigh the number of qualified applicants for available jobs, which will be exacerbated when scores of highly educated baby boomers retire. The share of workers with a baccalaureate degree will be 33 percent in 2030, below the 38 percent that will be needed.
(f) The impact of graduation rates from California State University campuses is felt not only throughout the state, but also the nation. One out of every 10 California employees is a California State University graduate, while one out of every 20 United States citizens with a college or university degree graduates from a campus of the California State University. These statistics emphasize the national importance of graduation rates at California State University campuses.
(g) It is the intent of the Legislature that the California State University system include the California Promise as a component of the plan submitted to the Legislature and the Department of Finance to increase graduation rates at CSU campuses above those at other institutions and increase graduation rates for low-income students, first-generation students, and students from underrepresented minority groups as quickly as possible.
(h) The California Promise programs established at the California State University in accordance with this part should aim to reflect the demographics of their respective campuses and make the benefits provided available on an equitable basis considering the populations attending each campus.
67434.
(a) The trustees shall develop and implement a California Promise program that complies with this part.
(b) Commencing with the 2017–18 academic year, a minimum of eight campuses shall have established a California Promise program by which the campus enters into a pledge with a qualifying student who is enrolled at the campus and who is not a transfer student to support the student in earning a baccalaureate degree within four academic years of the academic year of the student’s first year of enrollment.
(c) Commencing with the 2017–18 academic year, a minimum of 15 campuses shall have established a California Promise program by which the campus enters into a pledge with a qualifying transfer student to support the student in earning a baccalaureate degree program within two academic years of the student’s first year of enrollment to the campus, as applicable.
(d) Commencing with the 2018–19 academic year, a minimum of 20 campuses shall have established a California Promise program by which the campus enters into a pledge with a qualifying transfer student to support the student in earning a baccalaureate degree within two academic years of the student’s first year of enrollment to the campus, as applicable.
(e)To be a qualifying entering student or transfer student at the California State University, the student must comply with both of the following:
(1) Be a California resident for purposes of in-state tuition eligibility.
(2) Commit to completing at least 30 semester units or the quarter equivalent per academic year. Units completed by the student during a summer term may count towards the previous or following academic year as determined by the trustees.
(f) Each College Promise program shall be reviewed by a graduation initiative advisory committee of the campus or a committee with similar functions designated by the president of the campus.
(g) (1) A campus shall guarantee participation in the program to, at a minimum, any student who is any of the following:
(A) A low-income student. For purposes of this section, “low-income student” shall have the same meaning as specified in Section 89295.
(B) A student who has graduated from a high school located in a community that is underrepresented in college attendance.
(C) A student who is a first-generation college student.
(D) A transfer student.
(2) It is the intent of the Legislature that the California Promise program at each campus accommodate as many students into the program as feasible and in consideration of available funding.
(h) Support provided by a California State University campus to a student who participates in the California Promise program shall include, but not necessarily be limited to, both of the following:
(1) (A) Priority registration in coursework.
(B) For purposes of this paragraph, a student shall not receive priority registration in coursework under the program if he or she qualifies for priority registration under another policy or program, as determined by the campus or the Office of the Chancellor of the California State University.
(C) A graduation initiative advisory committee of the campus, or a committee with similar functions designated by the president of the campus, shall consider pre-existing priority registration policies when implementing this section.
(2) Academic advisement that includes monitoring the student’s academic progress.
(i) (1) The trustees shall develop application criteria, administrative guidelines, and additional requirements, including how campuses will measure student success, for purposes of implementing and administering the California Promise program.
(2) As a condition of continued participation in a California Promise program, a student may be required to demonstrate both of the following:
(A) Completion of at least 30 semester units, or the quarter equivalent, in each prior academic year.
(B) Attainment of a grade point average in excess of a standard established by the campus.
(3) In implementing this part, the trustees shall take into consideration the report on graduation rates required pursuant to Item 6610-001-0001 of Section 2.00 of the Budget Act of 2016.
(j) (1) The trustees shall submit a report to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature by July 1, 2021, that includes all of the following:
(A) The number of students participating in the program in total, by campus, and disaggregated based on the following:
(i) Whether the student entered as a first-time freshman or a transfer student.
(ii) Whether the student is a first-generation college student.
(iii) Whether the student is a recipient of financial aid under the Federal Pell Grant Program (20 U.S.C. Sec. 1070a) or the Cal Grant Program established in Chapter 1.7 (commencing with Section 69430) of Part 42.
(iv) According to the student’s ethnicity.
(B) The total number of students who graduated in four academic years for students who entered as first-time freshmen, and two academic years, for students who entered as transfer students, in total, by campus, and disaggregated based on the characteristics identified in clauses (i) to (iv), inclusive, or subparagraph (A).
(2) The report required by paragraph (1) shall include a summary description of significant differences in the implementation of the California Promise program at each campus.
(k) The trustees shall submit recommendations to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature by March 15, 2017, regarding potential financial incentives that could benefit students who participate in the California Promise program.
(l) A student who successfully completes his or her associate degree for transfer at a community college shall be guaranteed participation in the California Promise program at the California State University transfer campus, if established.
(m) The trustees shall make every effort to close the achievement gap and encourage broad participation in a California Promise program that reflects the demographic populations served by the campus.
67435.
This part shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2026, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2026, deletes or extends that date.

Existing law makes it a crime for any person in this state to manufacture, import into the state for sale, keep for sale, offer or expose for sale, give, or lend an unsafe handgun. Under existing law, this prohibition does not apply to the sale or purchase of a handgun if the handgun is sold to, or purchased by, a police department, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, or any federal law enforcement agency, among other entities.
This bill would also make the above prohibition inapplicable to the sale or purchase of a handgun if the handgun is sold to, or purchased by, specified entities or sworn members of those entities who have satisfactorily completed the firearms portion of a training course prescribed by the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training. The bill would prohibit a licensed firearms dealer from processing the sale or transfer of an unsafe handgun between a person who has obtained an unsafe handgun pursuant to this exemption and a person who is not exempt.
This bill would require a person, with exceptions, who obtains an unsafe handgun pursuant to this exemption to, when leaving the handgun in an unattended vehicle, as defined, lock the handgun in the vehicle’s trunk or lock the handgun in a locked container, as defined, and place the container out of plain view. The bill would make a violation of this provision an infraction punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

Existing law defines a transfer fee as a fee payment requirement imposed in any covenant, restriction, or condition contained in any deed, contract, security instrument, or other document affecting the transfer or sale of real property that requires a fee be paid upon transfer of the real property, with specified exceptions. Existing law, with regard to a transfer fee imposed upon real property on or after January 1, 2008, requires the person or entity imposing the transfer fee, as a condition of payment of the fee, to record a specified document describing the transfer fee concurrently with the instrument creating the transfer fee requirement. Existing law requires these recorded documents to include information on the amount of the fee and actual dollar examples of the fee for a residential property, among other things. Existing law requires a transferor of residential real property subject to transfer fees to make a specified disclosure regarding those fees.
This bill would specify that the required information on the recorded document include the method for calculating the amount of the transfer fee, if not a flat amount or a percentage of the sales price, and include the actual dollar examples of the fee for a residential property if the amount of the fee is based on the price of the real property. The bill would also require the transferor of residential real property subject to transfer fees to make the specified disclosure regarding those fees if the recorded document describing the transfer fees has not already been provided. The bill would also clarify the definition of a transfer fee.
Existing law excludes from the definition of a transfer fee any fee reflected in a document recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2007, that is separate from any covenants, conditions, and restrictions, and that provides a prospective transferee notice of specified information, including the amount or method of calculation of the fee.
This bill would specify that the information shall be set forth in a single document and may not be incorporated by reference from any other document.
This bill would provide that a fee reflected in a document recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2007, that is not separate from any covenants, conditions, and restrictions, or that incorporates by reference from another document, constitutes a transfer fee for the purposes of requirements relating to these fees. The bill would make unenforceable a transfer fee recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2007, that complies with the provisions described above and that incorporates by reference from another document unless it is recorded against the property on or before December 31, 2016, in a single document that complies with the provisions described above.
This bill would also make a legislative finding that certain changes made by this bill are clarifying and declaratory of existing law.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 34191.4 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
34191.4.
The following provisions shall apply to any successor agency that has been issued a finding of completion by the Department of Finance:
(a) All real property and interests in real property identified in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (5) of subdivision (c) of Section 34179.5 shall be transferred to the Community Redevelopment Property Trust Fund of the successor agency upon approval by the Department of Finance of the long-range property management plan submitted by the successor agency pursuant to subdivision (b) of Section 34191.5 unless that property is subject to the requirements of any existing enforceable obligation.
(b) (1) Except as provided in subdivision (c), and notwithstanding subdivision (d) of Section 34171, upon application by the successor agency and approval by the oversight board, loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency shall be deemed to be enforceable obligations provided that the oversight board makes a finding that the loan was for legitimate redevelopment purposes.
(2) If the oversight board finds that the loan is an enforceable obligation, the accumulated interest on the remaining principal amount of the loan shall be recalculated from origination at the interest rate earned by funds deposited into the Local Agency Investment Fund. The loan shall be repaid to the city, county, or city and county in accordance with a defined schedule over a reasonable term of years at an interest rate not to exceed the interest rate earned by funds deposited into the Local Agency Investment Fund. The annual loan repayments provided for in the recognized obligation payment schedules shall be subject to all of the following limitations:
(A) Loan repayments shall not be made prior to the 2013–14 fiscal year. Beginning in the 2013–14 fiscal year, the maximum repayment amount authorized each fiscal year for repayments made pursuant to this subdivision and paragraph (7) of subdivision (e) of Section 34176 combined shall be equal to one-half of the increase between the amount distributed to the taxing entities pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of Section 34183 in that fiscal year and the amount distributed to taxing entities pursuant to that paragraph in the 2012–13 base year, provided, however, that calculation of the amount distributed to taxing entities during the 2012–13 base year shall not include any amounts distributed to taxing entities pursuant to the due diligence review process established in Sections 34179.5 to 34179.8, inclusive. Loan or deferral repayments made pursuant to this subdivision shall be second in priority to amounts to be repaid pursuant to paragraph (7) of subdivision (e) of Section 34176.
(B) Repayments received by the city, county, or city and county that formed the redevelopment agency shall first be used to retire any outstanding amounts borrowed and owed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund of the former redevelopment agency for purposes of the Supplemental Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund and shall be distributed to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund established by subdivision (d) of Section 34176.
(C) Twenty percent of any loan repayment shall be deducted from the loan repayment amount and shall be transferred to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Asset Fund, after all outstanding loans from the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund for purposes of the Supplemental Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund have been paid.
(c) (1) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) and subdivision (d) of Section 34171, upon application by the successor agency and approval by the oversight board, loan agreements entered into between a redevelopment agency and the City of San Joaquin, where the outstanding principal balance of the loan is one million two hundred fifty thousand ($1,250,000) or less, shall be deemed to be enforceable obligations if the oversight board makes all of the following findings:
(A) The loan was for legitimate redevelopment purposes.
(B) The loan was entered into more than two years after the creation of the former redevelopment agency, and prior to January 1, 2011.
(C) The loan was related to an indebtedness obligation.
(D) The loan is the only debt of the former redevelopment agency remaining to be paid on the recognized obligation payment schedule.
(E) The amount distributed to the taxing entities pursuant to paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of Section 34183 in the previous fiscal year was less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).
(2) Repayments of a loan described in this subdivision are not subject to the requirements of paragraph (1) and subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b). The accumulated interest rate shall be recalculated from origination at the interest rate of 0.25 percent.
(d) (1) Bond proceeds derived from bonds issued on or before December 31, 2010, shall be used for the purposes for which the bonds were sold.
(2) (A) Notwithstanding Section 34177.3 or any other conflicting provision of law, bond proceeds in excess of the amounts needed to satisfy approved enforceable obligations shall thereafter be expended in a manner consistent with the original bond covenants. Enforceable obligations may be satisfied by the creation of reserves for projects that are the subject of the enforceable obligation and that are consistent with the contractual obligations for those projects, or by expending funds to complete the projects. An expenditure made pursuant to this paragraph shall constitute the creation of excess bond proceeds obligations to be paid from the excess proceeds. Excess bond proceeds obligations shall be listed separately on the Recognized Obligation Payment Schedule submitted by the successor agency.
(B) If remaining bond proceeds cannot be spent in a manner consistent with the bond covenants pursuant to subparagraph (A), the proceeds shall be used to defease the bonds or to purchase those same outstanding bonds on the open market for cancellation.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the special circumstances relating to the health and safety of the residents of the City of San Joaquin.

Existing law dissolved redevelopment agencies and community development agencies as of February 1, 2012, and provides for the designation of successor agencies to wind down the affairs of the dissolved redevelopment agencies, subject to review by oversight boards, and to, among other things, make payments due for enforceable obligations and to perform obligations required pursuant to any enforceable obligation. Existing law requires the Department of Finance to issue a finding of completion to a successor agency upon confirmation by the county auditor-controller that specified payments have been fully made by the successor agency. Existing law defines “enforceable obligation” for these purposes to generally exclude any agreements, contracts, or arrangements between the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency and the former redevelopment agency. However, existing law provides that upon application by the successor agency and approval by the oversight board, loan agreements entered into between the redevelopment agency and the city, county, or city and county that created the redevelopment agency are deemed to be enforceable obligations provided that the oversight board makes a finding that the loan was for legitimate redevelopment purposes.
This bill would additionally provide that upon application by the successor agency and approval by the oversight board, loan agreements entered into between a redevelopment agency and the City of San Joaquin, where the outstanding principal balance of the loan is $1,250,000 or less, are enforceable obligations if the oversight board finds, among other things, that the loan was for legitimate redevelopment purposes, it was entered into more than 2 years after the creation of the former redevelopment agency and prior to January 1, 2011, and it is the only debt of the former redevelopment agency remaining to be paid on the recognized obligation payment schedule.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of San Joaquin.

The Private Investigator Act provides for the licensure and regulation of private investigators by the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services within the Department of Consumer Affairs and requires the Director of Consumer Affairs to administer and enforce the act. The act authorizes the director to deny, suspend, or revoke a license if the director determines, among other things, that any provision of the act was violated by the licensee. The act also authorizes the director to impose a civil penalty of no greater than $500 instead of suspending or revoking a license issued under the act for the violation of specified provisions if the director determines that the imposition of the civil penalty better serves the purposes of the act. The act requires an application for a license to be verified and include certain information, including, but not limited to, the full name and business address of the applicant.
This bill would require the Governor to appoint a Private Investigator Disciplinary Review Committee, and would authorize the Governor to remove any member of the committee for misconduct, incompetency, or neglect of duty. The bill would require the committee to consist of 3 members actively engaged in the business of a licensed private investigator and 2 public members and would require members to be appointed for a term of 4 years. The bill would require the committee to meet every 60 days or more or less frequently as may be required, and would require that the members be paid per diem and be reimbursed for actual travel expenses. The bill would require the committee to perform certain functions, including affirming, rescinding, or modifying decisions concerning administrative fines or the denial, suspension, or revocation of licenses that are appealed to the committee, as specified. The bill would authorize the committee to grant a probationary license with respect to appealed decisions, as specified. The bill would authorize a person licensed under the act to appeal the assessment of an administrative fine to the committee, and would authorize a person denied, suspended of, or revoked of a license to appeal to the committee, except as specified, if the appeal is in writing and made within 30 days of the assessment of the fine or denial, suspension, or revocation of the license. The bill would require the committee to notify the appellant in writing, by regular mail, of the committee’s decision within 30 days of that decision. The bill would also authorize the appellant to request a hearing, as specified, if, among other things, the appellant disagrees with the committee’s decision regarding the appeal. The bill would require that all evidence used by the bureau be provided to the committee prior to hearing an appeal. The bill would make the above provisions operative on July 1, 2017.
This bill would also authorize an applicant to, at his or her discretion, include a valid email address on the application.
Existing law requires an applicant, or his or her manager, for a license as a private investigator to have had at least 3 years’ experience in investigation work. Existing law requires an applicant to substantiate the claimed years of qualifying experience and the exact details as to the character and nature thereof by written certifications from the employer, subject to independent verification by the Director of Consumer Affairs as he or she may determine. Under existing law, the business of each licensee is required to be operated under the active direction, control, charge, or management, in this state, of the licensee, if he or she is qualified, or the person who is qualified to act as the licensee’s manager, if the licensee is not qualified. Existing law prohibits a person from acting as a qualified manager of a licensee until he or she has complied with certain requirements.
This bill would additionally authorize that written certification to be from a qualified manager, as specified.
Existing law requires experience for purposes of taking the examination for licensure as a private investigator to be limited to those activities actually performed in connection with investigations, as defined, and only if those activities are performed by persons who are employed in certain specified capacities.
This bill would additionally authorize such activities to be performed by persons who are managed, as specified, in those capacities.

(1) Existing law authorizes certain persons, including, among others, any person 16 years of age or older, to have his or her proficiency in basic skills taught in public high schools verified according to criteria established by the State Department of Education. Existing law requires the State Board of Education to award a certificate of proficiency to persons who demonstrate that proficiency. Existing law requires the department to develop standards of competency in basic skills taught in public high schools and to provide for the administration of examinations prepared by, or with the approval of, the department to verify competency. Existing law authorizes the department to charge a fee for each examination application in an amount sufficient to recover the costs of administering the requirements of these provisions, but prohibits the fee from exceeding an amount equal to the cost of test renewal and administration per examination application.
This bill would prohibit the department from charging the fee to a homeless child or youth who is under 25 years of age and can verify his or her status as a homeless child or youth. The bill would authorize a homeless services provider, as defined, that has knowledge of the examinee’s housing status to verify the examinee’s status for purposes of these provisions. The bill would provide that no additional state funds shall be appropriated for purposes of implementing the above provisions. The bill would authorize the state board to adopt emergency regulations for purposes of these provisions.
(2) Existing law separately requires the Superintendent of Public Instruction to issue a high school equivalency certificate and an official score report, or an official score report only, to a person who has not completed high school and who meets specified requirements, including, among others, having taken all or a portion of a general education development test that has been approved by the state board and administered by a testing center approved by the department, with a score determined by the state board to be equal to the standard of performance expected from high school graduates. Existing law authorizes the Superintendent to charge an examinee a one-time fee to pay costs related to administering these provisions and issuing a certificate, as specified. Existing law limits the amount of the fee to $20 per person and requires each scoring contractor to forward that fee to the Superintendent.
This bill would, for purposes of those provisions, prohibit a contractor or testing center that charges its own separate fee from charging that separate fee to a homeless child or youth who is under 25 years of age and can verify his or her status as a homeless child or youth. The bill would authorize a homeless services provider, as defined, that has knowledge of the examinee’s housing status to verify the examinee’s status for purposes of these provisions. The bill would provide that no additional state funds shall be appropriated for purposes of implementing these provisions, and would authorize the Superintendent to adopt emergency regulations for purposes of these provisions.
(3) Existing law establishes in the State Treasury a Special Deposit Fund Account, which consists of certain fees, and is continuously appropriated for the support of the department to be used for purposes of the provisions above relating to high school equivalency tests.
This bill would authorize the Superintendent, until July 1, 2019, to use surplus funds, as defined, in the Special Deposit Fund Account to reimburse contractors for the loss of fees, if any, pursuant to provisions above relating to high school equivalency tests. By authorizing the expenditure of money in a continuously appropriated fund for a new purpose, this bill would make an appropriation. The bill would require a contract executed by the department for the provision of those tests to require a contracting party to accept all examinees, including those entitled to a fee waiver pursuant to those provisions. The bill also would require the department to include a provision in all memorandums of understanding with contractors for purposes of providing a high school equivalency test, that if the surplus funds in the Special Deposit Fund Account are depleted, the ongoing costs of a fee waiver for an examinee deemed eligible for a waiver shall be absorbed by the contractor.
(4) This bill also would require the department, on or before December 1, 2018, to submit 2 reports to the appropriate policy and fiscal committees of the Legislature, one relating to high school proficiency tests, and one relating to high school equivalency tests, that each include, among other things, the number of homeless youth that took a high school proficiency or equivalency test in each of the 2016, 2017, and 2018 calendar years, and the impact of the opportunity to take a high school proficiency or equivalency test at no cost on the number and percentage of homeless youth taking a high school proficiency or equivalency test.

Existing law requires the Department of General Services to provide planning, acquisition, construction, and maintenance of state buildings and property, and maintain a statewide property inventory of all real property held by the state.
This bill would authorize the Director of General Services to revert a specified parcel of state real property to the City of San Buenaventura pursuant to these provisions.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the City of San Buenaventura.
Under existing law, the meetings of school district governing boards are subject to the provisions of the Ralph M. Brown Act, which generally requires that the meetings of the governing boards of local agencies be open to the public with proper notice given, permit the recording of those meetings, prohibit legislative bodies from taking action by secret ballot and set forth other specific requirements for the conduct of those meetings. Existing law exempts the meetings of specified schoolsite councils and committees from the Ralph M. Brown Act and the Bagley-Keen Open Meeting Act, but still requires properly noticed public meetings with posted agendas.
This bill would delete obsolete statutory references from this provision and would correct references to certain parent advisory committees that fall within this exemption. The bill would also make nonsubstantive changes.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares both of the following:
(a) Improving occupational health and safety in all lines of work is a priority for the State of California, and that focus should extend to family child care providers. Improving health and safety for family child care providers will also protect the health and safety of the children under their care, because a safer and healthier environment for family child care providers means a safer and healthier environment for children.
(b) Family child care providers are at risk for occupational health and safety hazards on the job, including from toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical hazards such as lifting and bending. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, child care workers have musculoskeletal injury rates comparable to those of industrial truck and tractor operators and construction equipment operators. Since family child care providers are not covered by workers’ compensation insurance, it is particularly important to them and to the children under their care that they be trained to avoid injury and illness on the job.
SEC. 2.
Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to read:
1596.86.
(a) The director shall annually publish and make available to interested persons a list or lists covering all licensed child day care facilities, other than small family day care homes, and the services for which each facility has been licensed or issued a special permit. The lists shall also specify the licensed capacity of the facility and whether it is licensed by the department or by another public agency.
(b)  To encourage the recruitment of small family day care homes and protect their personal privacy, the department shall prevent the use of lists containing names,
addresses
addresses,
and other identifying information of facilities identified as small family day care homes, except as necessary for administering the licensing program, facilitating the placement of children in these facilities, and providing the names and addresses to resource and referral agencies funded by the State Department of Education, food and nutrition programs funded by the State Department of Education, alternative payment programs funded by the State Department of Education, county programs under the Greater Avenues for Independence Act of 1985 (Article 3.2 (commencing with Section 11320) of Chapter 2 of Part 3 of Division 9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code),
the entity selected to provide the trainings required pursuant to Section 1596.864,
family day care organizations, or specialized health care service plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975, as contained in Chapter 2.5 (commencing with Section 1340), which provide employee assistance program services that include child care referral services. Upon request, parents seeking local day care services may receive the names and telephone numbers of local small family day care providers.
(c)  The department, in consultation with the Child Development Division of the State Department of Education, shall adopt regulations relating to the confidentiality of information provided pursuant to subdivision (b) on small family day care homes. These regulations shall include procedures for updating lists or other information on small family day care providers to ensure referral only to licensed homes in good standing with the department. Any person or entity violating the regulations under this subdivision may be denied access by the department to information on small family day care homes and shall be reported by the department to the appropriate funding or licensing department.
SEC. 3.

(2) “Publicly funded child care program” means a program to subsidize early learning and care for children that is administered by the State Department of Education, the State Department of Social Services, or another department, agency, or political subdivision of the state, including, but not limited to, child care voucher programs, contracted child care slots, the California State Preschool Program, and programs established subsequent to the passage of this section, but not including the K-12 public education system.
(b) A family child care provider shall attend a one-time, two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession and how to identify and avoid those risks to protect the provider’s own health and safety and the health and safety of the children in his or her care.
(c) The State Department of Social Services may establish a schedule according to which all family child care providers shall be required to complete the training in no less than four years from when the training is first offered pursuant to this section, or within three months of the provider becoming a family child care provider, whichever occurs later. In establishing this schedule, the department shall prioritize the training of licensed family child care providers.
(d) The training sessions required pursuant to subdivision (b) shall include all of the following:

(B) Trains family child care providers to give the training required by this section to other providers.
(C) Will provide periodic updates on health and safety matters to providers who have completed the training.
(2) The entity selected to provide the training required by this section shall develop the curriculum for the training sessions with input from family child care providers. The curriculum shall be reviewed and approved by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health within the Department of Industrial Relations.
(3) The State Department of Social Services shall administer the contract with the entity selected to provide the training.
(f) The training required by this section shall be coordinated, to the extent possible, with other preservice training requirements for family child care providers, and with resource and referral networks, so as to reduce the burden on providers.
(g) On a monthly basis, the department shall provide lists of the family child care providers who have attended the training and of those who are required to attend the training, but have not yet attended, and their contact information, to the entity selected to provide the training. The entity shall use that information for the purpose of providing family child care providers with periodic updates on health and safety issues and other educational information.

SEC. 2.
Section 8221.6 is added to the
Education Code
, to read:
8221.6.
(a)A licensed or license-exempt child care provider who receives payment through the alternative payment program may file a complaint, alleging that an alternative payment program has not complied with federal or state law or regulation, pursuant to the Uniform Complaint Procedures set forth in Chapter 5.1 (commencing with Section 4600) of Division 1 of Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations.
(b)For purposes of this section, alternative payment programs are operated by contractors reimbursed under the following contract types:

Existing law requires the State Department of Social Services to license and regulate family day care home providers and to regulate other nonlicensed persons who provide in-home child care. Violation of these provisions is a crime.
This bill, as of July 1, 2017, would require a family child care provider, as defined, to attend a one-time, two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession and how to identify and avoid those risks to protect the provider’s own health and safety and the health and safety of the children in his or her care. The bill would require the Department of Industrial Relations to select an entity to provide the training required, based on a competitive process, and would require the State Department of Social Services to administer the contract with that entity. By creating a new crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law, the Child Care and Development Services Act, requires the State Department of Education to contract with local contracting agencies for alternative payment programs that are intended to allow for maximum parental choice in child care.
This bill would provide that a licensed or license-exempt child care provider who receives payment through a designated alternative payment program may file a complaint, alleging that the alternative payment program has not complied with federal or state law or regulation, pursuant to the Uniform Complaint Procedures in the California Code of Regulations, as specified.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 4610 of the Labor Code is amended to read:
4610.
(a) For purposes of this section, “utilization review” means utilization review or utilization management functions that prospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently review and approve, modify, delay, or deny, based in whole or in part on medical necessity to cure and relieve, treatment recommendations by physicians, as defined in Section 3209.3, prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of medical treatment services pursuant to Section 4600.
(b) Every employer shall establish a utilization review process in compliance with this section, either directly or through its insurer or an entity with which an employer or insurer contracts for these services.
(c) Each utilization review process shall be governed by written policies and procedures. These policies and procedures shall ensure that decisions based on the medical necessity to cure and relieve of proposed medical treatment services are consistent with the schedule for medical treatment utilization adopted pursuant to Section 5307.27. These policies and procedures, and a description of the utilization process, shall be filed with the administrative director and shall be disclosed by the employer to employees, physicians, and the public upon request.
(d) If an employer, insurer, or other entity subject to this section requests medical information from a physician in order to determine whether to approve, modify, delay, or deny requests for authorization, the employer shall request only the information reasonably necessary to make the determination. The employer, insurer, or other entity shall employ or designate a medical director who holds an unrestricted license to practice medicine in this state issued pursuant to Section 2050 or 2450 of the Business and Professions Code. The medical director shall ensure that the process by which the employer or other entity reviews and approves, modifies, delays, or denies requests by physicians prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provision of medical treatment services, complies with the requirements of this section. Nothing in this section shall be construed as restricting the existing authority of the Medical Board of California.
(e) (1) No person other than a licensed physician who is competent to evaluate the specific clinical issues involved in the medical treatment services, and where these services are within the scope of the physician’s practice, requested by the physician may modify, delay, or deny requests for authorization of medical treatment for reasons of medical necessity to cure and relieve.
(2) (A) The employer, or any entity conducting utilization review on behalf of the employer, shall neither offer nor provide any financial incentive or consideration to a physician based on the number of modifications, delays, or denials made by the physician under this section.
(B) An insurer or third-party administrator shall not refer utilization review services conducted on behalf of an employer under this section to an entity in which the insurer or third-party administrator has a financial interest as defined under Section 139.32. This prohibition does not apply if the insurer or third-party administrator provides the employer with prior written disclosure of both of the following:
(i) The entity conducting the utilization review services.
(ii) The insurer or third-party administrator’s financial interest in the entity.
(3) The administrative director has authority pursuant to this section to review any compensation agreement, payment schedule, or contract between the employer, or any entity conducting utilization review on behalf of the employer, and the utilization review physician. Any information disclosed to the administrative director pursuant to this paragraph shall be considered confidential information and not subject to disclosure pursuant to the California Public Records Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 6250) of Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government
Code) unless the division can demonstrate that the information was in the public domain at the time it was disclosed or has entered the public domain through no fault of the division.
Code).
Disclosure of the information to the administrative director pursuant to this subdivision shall not waive the provisions of the Evidence Code relating to privilege.
(f) The criteria or guidelines used in the utilization review process to determine whether to approve, modify, delay, or deny medical treatment services shall be all of the following:
(1) Developed with involvement from actively practicing physicians.
(2) Consistent with the schedule for medical treatment utilization adopted pursuant to Section 5307.27.
(3) Evaluated at least annually, and updated if necessary.
(4) Disclosed to the physician and the employee, if used as the basis of a decision to modify, delay, or deny services in a specified case under review.
(5) Available to the public upon request. An employer shall only be required to disclose the criteria or guidelines for the specific procedures or conditions requested. An employer may charge members of the public reasonable copying and postage expenses related to disclosing criteria or guidelines pursuant to this paragraph. Criteria or guidelines may also be made available through electronic means. No charge shall be required for an employee whose physician’s request for medical treatment services is under review.
(g) In determining whether to approve, modify, delay, or deny requests by physicians prior to, retrospectively, or concurrent with the provisions of medical treatment services to employees all of the following requirements shall be met:
(1) Prospective or concurrent decisions shall be made in a timely fashion that is appropriate for the nature of the employee’s condition, not to exceed five working days from the receipt of the information reasonably necessary to make the determination, but in no event more than 14 days from the date of the medical treatment recommendation by the physician. In cases where the review is retrospective, a decision resulting in denial of all or part of the medical treatment service shall be communicated to the individual who received services, or to the individual’s designee, within 30 days of receipt of information that is reasonably necessary to make this determination. If payment for a medical treatment service is made within the time prescribed by Section 4603.2, a retrospective decision to approve the service need not otherwise be communicated.
(2) When the employee’s condition is such that the employee faces an imminent and serious threat to his or her health, including, but not limited to, the potential loss of life, limb, or other major bodily function, or the normal timeframe for the decisionmaking process, as described in paragraph (1), would be detrimental to the employee’s life or health or could jeopardize the employee’s ability to regain maximum function, decisions to approve, modify, delay, or deny requests by physicians prior to, or concurrent with, the provision of medical treatment services to employees shall be made in a timely fashion that is appropriate for the nature of the employee’s condition, but not to exceed 72 hours after the receipt of the information reasonably necessary to make the determination.
(3) (A) Decisions to approve, modify, delay, or deny requests by physicians for authorization prior to, or concurrent with, the provision of medical treatment services to employees shall be communicated to the requesting physician within 24 hours of the decision. Decisions resulting in modification, delay, or denial of all or part of the requested health care service shall be communicated to physicians initially by telephone or facsimile, and to the physician and employee in writing within 24 hours for concurrent review, or within two business days of the decision for prospective review, as prescribed by the administrative director. If the request is not approved in full, disputes shall be resolved in accordance with Section 4610.5, if applicable, or otherwise in accordance with Section 4062.
(B) In the case of concurrent review, medical care shall not be discontinued until the employee’s physician has been notified of the decision and a care plan has been agreed upon by the physician that is appropriate for the medical needs of the employee. Medical care provided during a concurrent review shall be care that is medically necessary to cure and relieve, and an insurer or self-insured employer shall only be liable for those services determined medically necessary to cure and relieve. If the insurer or self-insured employer disputes whether or not one or more services offered concurrently with a utilization review were medically necessary to cure and relieve, the dispute shall be resolved pursuant to Section 4610.5, if applicable, or otherwise pursuant to Section 4062. Any compromise between the parties that an insurer or self-insured employer believes may result in payment for services that were not medically necessary to cure and relieve shall be reported by the insurer or the self-insured employer to the licensing board of the provider or providers who received the payments, in a manner set forth by the respective board and in such a way as to minimize reporting costs both to the board and to the insurer or self-insured employer, for evaluation as to possible violations of the statutes governing appropriate professional practices. No fees shall be levied upon insurers or self-insured employers making reports required by this section.
(4) Communications regarding decisions to approve requests by physicians shall specify the specific medical treatment service approved. Responses regarding decisions to modify, delay, or deny medical treatment services requested by physicians shall include a clear and concise explanation of the reasons for the employer’s decision, a description of the criteria or guidelines used, and the clinical reasons for the decisions regarding medical necessity. If a utilization review decision to deny or delay a medical service is due to incomplete or insufficient information, the decision shall specify the reason for the decision and specify the information that is needed.
(5) If the employer, insurer, or other entity cannot make a decision within the timeframes specified in paragraph (1) or (2) because the employer or other entity is not in receipt of all of the information reasonably necessary and requested, because the employer requires consultation by an expert reviewer, or because the employer has asked that an additional examination or test be performed upon the employee that is reasonable and consistent with good medical practice, the employer shall immediately notify the physician and the employee, in writing, that the employer cannot make a decision within the required timeframe, and specify the information requested but not received, the expert reviewer to be consulted, or the additional examinations or tests required. The employer shall also notify the physician and employee of the anticipated date on which a decision may be rendered. Upon receipt of all information reasonably necessary and requested by the employer, the employer shall approve, modify, or deny the request for authorization within the timeframes specified in paragraph (1) or (2).
(6) A utilization review decision to modify, delay, or deny a treatment recommendation shall remain effective for 12 months from the date of the decision without further action by the employer with regard to any further recommendation by the same physician for the same treatment unless the further recommendation is supported by a documented change in the facts material to the basis of the utilization review decision.
(7) Utilization review of a treatment recommendation shall not be required while the employer is disputing liability for injury or treatment of the condition for which treatment is recommended pursuant to Section 4062.
(8) If utilization review is deferred pursuant to paragraph (7), and it is finally determined that the employer is liable for treatment of the condition for which treatment is recommended, the time for the employer to conduct retrospective utilization review in accordance with paragraph (1) shall begin on the date the determination of the employer’s liability becomes final, and the time for the employer to conduct prospective utilization review shall commence from the date of the employer’s receipt of a treatment recommendation after the determination of the employer’s liability.
(h) Every employer, insurer, or other entity subject to this section shall maintain telephone access for physicians to request authorization for health care services.
(i) If the administrative director determines that the employer, insurer, or other entity subject to this section has failed to meet any of the timeframes in this section, or has failed to meet any other requirement of this section, the administrative director may assess, by order, administrative penalties for each failure. A proceeding for the issuance of an order assessing administrative penalties shall be subject to appropriate notice to, and an opportunity for a hearing with regard to, the person affected. The administrative penalties shall not be deemed to be an exclusive remedy for the administrative director. These penalties shall be deposited in the Workers’ Compensation Administration Revolving Fund.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which amends Section 4610 of the Labor Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
The limitations on the people’s rights of access set forth in this act are necessary to protect the privacy and integrity of information submitted to the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers’ Compensation pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (e) of Section 4610 of the Labor Code.

Actual Output
Existing law requires every employer, for purposes of workers’ compensation, to establish a utilization review process to prospectively, retrospectively, or concurrently review requests by physicians for authorization to provide recommended medical treatment to injured employees. Existing law establishes timeframes for an employer to make a determination regarding a physician’s request. Existing law requires the utilization review process to be governed by written policies and procedures, and requires that these policies and procedures be filed with the Administrative Director of the Division of Workers’ Compensation and disclosed by the employer to employees, physicians, and the public upon request.
This bill would prohibit the employer, or any entity conducting utilization review on behalf of the employer, from offering or providing any financial incentive or consideration to a physician based on the number of modifications, delays, or denials made by the physician. The bill would authorize the administrative director to review any compensation agreement, payment schedule, or contract between the employer, or any entity conducting utilization review on behalf of the employer, and the utilization review physician. The bill would make any information disclosed to the administrative director confidential and not subject to public disclosure, except as specified.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.

(1) The Nonprofit Corporation Law authorizes a presiding officer of a religious denomination, society, or church to form a corporation sole for the purpose of administering and managing its affairs. The law requires the Secretary of State to file articles of incorporation of a corporation sole, if the articles of incorporation conform to law.
This bill would require the Secretary of State, if he or she determines the articles of incorporation to form a corporation sole did not conform to law, to nonetheless file it if the articles of incorporation are resubmitted with an accompanying written opinion of a member of the State Bar of California that the specific provision of the articles of incorporation objected to by the Secretary of State conform to law and state the points and authorities upon which the written opinion is based.
(2) Subject to conformance with law and filing with the Secretary of State, the Nonprofit Corporation Law authorizes a chief officer of a corporation sole to amend the articles of incorporation if the amendment includes a signed and verified statement setting forth the provisions of the amendment and stating that the amendment has been duly authorized by the religious organization governed by the corporation sole. The law also requires a declaration of dissolution of a corporation sole to include, among other things, a statement that the dissolution of the corporation sole has been duly authorized by the religious organization governed by the corporation sole.
This bill would expand those provisions to also allow those statements to be duly authorized by the hierarchical religious organization or entity responsible for forming the corporation sole, or by the hierarchical religious organization or entity responsible for overseeing the corporation sole according to the rules, canons, regulations, or discipline of the religious denomination, society, or church as to which the corporation sole is affiliated.
(3) The Nonprofit Corporation Law requires any assets of a dissolved corporation sole remaining after satisfying its debts and obligations to be transferred to the religious organization governed by the corporation sole, or to trustees on its behalf, or disposed of as may be decreed by the superior court of the county in which the dissolved corporation sole had its principal office.
This bill would additionally authorize those assets to be transferred to the trustees on behalf of the corporation sole, the hierarchical religious organization or entity responsible for forming the corporation sole, or the hierarchical religious organization or entity responsible for overseeing the corporation sole according to the rules, canons, regulations, or discipline of the religious denomination, society, or church to which the corporation sole is affiliated.
(4) This bill would also make various conforming and nonsubstantive changes.

Existing law establishes the Capital Access Loan Program to assist small businesses in financing the costs of complying with environmental mandates and the remediation of contamination on their properties, and also establishes within the program the California Americans with Disabilities Act Small Business Capital Access Loan Program to assist small businesses in financing the costs of projects that alter or retrofit existing small business facilities to comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. Under existing law, both programs are administered by the California Pollution Control Financing Authority (authority).
This bill would establish within the Capital Access Loan Program the California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program to assist residential property owners and small business owners in seismically retrofitting residences and small businesses by covering losses on qualified loans for those purposes, as specified. The bill would require the authority to administer the program, including regulations and funds received for the program, as specified. The bill would also authorize the authority to, by regulation, implement loan loss reserve programs to benefit any individual person engaged in qualifying activities that require financing, as specified.
This bill would establish the California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program Fund and would continuously appropriate that fund to the authority to carry out the purposes of the California Seismic Safety Capital Access Loan Program.
The Personal Income Tax Law and the Corporation Tax Law allow various credits against the taxes imposed by those laws.
This bill, for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, and before January 1, 2022, would allow a tax credit under both laws in an amount equal to 30% of the qualified costs paid or incurred by a qualified taxpayer for any seismic retrofit construction on a qualified building, as provided. The bill would require a taxpayer, in order to be eligible for the credit, to obtain 2 certifications from the appropriate jurisdiction with authority for building code enforcement of the area in which the building is located: one prior to seismic retrofit construction that certifies that the building is an at-risk property, and a second subsequent to construction that certifies that the completed construction is seismic retrofit construction, as defined, and specifies a dollar amount of qualified costs. The bill would further require the taxpayer to provide the second certification to, and apply for the allocation of the credit with, the Franchise Tax Board. The bill would require the Franchise Tax Board to allocate credits on a first-come-first-served basis. The bill would provide that the credit would have an aggregate cap under both laws of $12,000,000 plus the amount of previously unallocated credit for each calendar year, as provided.
Existing law requires a bill that would authorize a new credit against the tax imposed by the Personal Income Tax Law or the Corporation Tax Law to contain specific goals, purposes, and objectives that the new credit will achieve and detailed performance indicators and data collection requirements for determining whether the new credit achieves these goals, purposes, and objectives.
This bill would make findings specifying the goals, purposes, and objectives of the above-described tax credits and detailing the performance indicators and data collection requirements for determining whether the credits meet these goals, purposes, and objectives.
This bill would take effect immediately as a tax levy.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Various economic studies have shown that the biggest burden on family incomes is the cost of housing and transportation. These two variables greatly affect the quality of life for Californians.
(b) Los Angeles County voters have recognized the importance of investing in a transportation network that is responsive to the needs of commuters and transit users and that facilitates the movement of goods in the region. Los Angeles County has three existing voter-approved sales tax measures for transportation projects administered by Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA).
(c) In 1980, voters in Los Angeles County approved Proposition A, a sales tax of one-half of 1 percent on most retail sales in Los Angeles County. The MTA returns 25 percent of Proposition A proceeds to the cities in Los Angeles County for transportation purposes. Thirty-five percent of Proposition A proceeds is required to be used for rail development while the remaining 40 percent is for discretionary purposes. Almost all of the discretionary portion is used to fund bus service provided by the MTA and 16 other municipal bus operators within Los Angeles County. The collection of the sales tax is ongoing.
(d) In 1990, voters in Los Angeles County approved Proposition C, an additional sales tax of one-half of 1 percent on retail sales in Los Angeles County. The MTA returns 20 percent of Proposition C proceeds to the cities in Los Angeles County for transportation purposes. Forty percent of the Proposition C proceeds is required to be used for construction and operation of the bus transit and rail system, 5 percent to expand rail and bus security, 10 percent for commuter
rail,
rail
and construction of transit centers, park and ride lots, and freeway bus stops, and 25 percent for transit-related improvements to freeways and state highways. The collection of the sales tax is ongoing.
(e) Most recently, voters in Los Angeles County approved Measure R in 2008. Measure R is an ordinance authorizing an additional sales tax of one-half of 1 percent to fund traffic relief and rail expansion according to an expenditure plan contained in the ordinance. Measure R became effective July 1, 2009, and will remain in effect for 30 years.
(f) MTA has been entrusted with the responsibility and has the voters’ confidence that it will protect and use the sales tax funding responsibly and according to the rules approved by the voters.
SEC. 2.
Section 130350.7 is added to the Public Utilities Code, to read:
130350.7.
(a) The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), in addition to any other tax it is authorized to impose or has imposed, may impose a transactions and use tax at the rate of 0.5 percent, for a period not to exceed 30 years, that is applicable in the incorporated and unincorporated areas of the County of Los Angeles.
(b) The ordinance imposing the tax shall contain all of the following:
(1) An expenditure plan that lists the transportation projects and programs to be funded from net revenues from the tax. The expenditure plan shall appear in the ordinance as an exhibit. The expenditure plan shall include measures that ensure net revenues are shared equitably between regions of the county.
(2) Provisions conforming to the Transactions and Use Tax Law (Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code), except as otherwise provided in subdivision (f).
(3) A provision limiting the MTA’s costs of administering the ordinance and the net revenues from the tax to 1.5 percent of the total tax revenues.
(4) A requirement that the net revenues from the tax, defined to mean the total tax revenues less any refunds, costs of administration by the State Board of Equalization, and the MTA’s administration costs, shall be used by the MTA to fund transportation projects and programs identified in the expenditure plan.
(5) A requirement that the MTA, during the period that the ordinance is operative, allocate
____
20
percent of all net revenues derived from the tax for bus operations. These revenues shall be allocated to all eligible and included municipal transit operators in the County of Los Angeles and to the MTA, in accordance with Section 99285. However, the allocations to the MTA and eligible and included municipal operators shall be made solely from revenues derived from a tax imposed pursuant to this section, and not from local discretionary sources. Funds allocated by MTA to itself pursuant to this section shall be used for transit operations and shall not supplant funds from any other source allocated by MTA to itself for public transit operations. Funds allocated by MTA to the eligible and included municipal operators pursuant to this section shall be used for transit operations and shall not supplant any funds authorized by other provisions of law and allocated by MTA to the eligible and included municipal operators for public transit. In addition to this amount, the MTA shall allocate
____
5
percent of all net revenues derived from the tax for rail operations.
(c) The MTA shall notify the Legislature prior to the adoption of amendments to the adopted expenditure plan.
(d) The ordinance shall be adopted by the MTA board, which shall also adopt a resolution that submits the ordinance to the voters.
(e) The ordinance shall become operative pursuant to Section 130352 if approved by two-thirds of the voters voting on the measure, pursuant to subdivision (d) of Section 2 of Article XIII C of the California Constitution.
(f) The MTA may incur bonded indebtedness payable from the net revenues of the tax pursuant to the bond issuance provisions of this chapter and any successor act.
(g) The tax authorized by this section shall be imposed pursuant to the Transactions and Use Tax Law (Part 1.6 (commencing with Section 7251) of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code), notwithstanding the combined rate limitation in Section 7251.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

Existing law authorizes the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) to impose, in addition to any other tax that it is authorized to impose, a transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.5% for the funding of specified transportation-related projects and programs, subject to various requirements, including the adoption of an expenditure plan and voter approval. Existing law authorizes the MTA to seek voter approval to extend the transactions and use tax pursuant to an amended ordinance, subject to various requirements, including adoption of an amended expenditure plan that, among other things, updates certain cost estimates and identifies expected completion dates for projects and programs under the previous expenditure plan, and also requires the amended expenditure plan to be included in an updated long range transportation plan, as specified.
This bill would authorize the MTA to impose an additional transportation transactions and use tax at a rate of 0.5%, for a period not to exceed 30 years, subject to various requirements, including the adoption of an expenditure plan and voter approval.
The Transactions and Use Tax Law limits to 2% the combined rate of all transactions and use taxes imposed in any county, with certain exceptions.
This bill would exempt the transactions and use tax authorized by the bill from this limitation.

Existing law establishes procedures for conducting expedited jury trials in civil cases where the parties sign a consent order to stipulate that those procedures apply. Pursuant to these procedures, all parties agree that each side has up to 3 hours to present its case and agree to waive all rights to appeal and to move for a directed verdict or to make any posttrial motions, except as provided. Existing law repeals these provisions on January 1, 2016.
This bill would modify procedures to provide that each party would have up to 5 hours to complete voir dire and present its case. The bill would require the Judicial Council to update rules and forms relating to these procedures by July 1, 2016. The bill would also delete the January 1, 2016, repeal date, thereby extending the operation of these provisions indefinitely.
Existing law requires that a designated action or special proceeding meeting certain conditions be treated as a limited civil case. Existing law authorizes a limited civil case to be brought in the small claims division if the case is within the jurisdiction of the small claims division as otherwise provided by statute.
The bill would establish procedures for conducting mandatory expedited jury trials in limited civil cases, including provisions for a jury of 8 or few members, with one alternate, and a limit of 5 hours for each side to complete voir dire and to present its case. The bill would authorize either party to opt out of the expedited jury trial procedures if certain requirements are met. The bill would provide that the verdict in an expedited jury trial case may be appealed and is subject to any written high/low agreement, as defined. The bill would require the Judicial Council to adopt additional rules and uniform procedures, as provided, by July 1, 2016.
The bill would delay the operative date of specified provisions relating to mandatory expedited jury trials until July 1, 2016. The bill would also repeal the provisions relating to mandatory expedited jury trials on July 1, 2019.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Substance abuse is a medical condition requiring interdisciplinary treatment including, when medically necessary, treatment by a licensed physician and surgeon.
(b) Subsequent to the enactment of state law licensing and regulating residential facilities providing alcohol and other drug detoxification treatment, public knowledge of addiction and treatment has advanced significantly.
(c) Lack of scientific understanding at the time of enactment of those state laws prevents the State Department of Health Care Services from licensing a residential treatment facility that uses a California-licensed physician and surgeon to provide necessary evaluation and treatment at the facility premises.
(d) This prohibition has been found to endanger persons in treatment, can result in treatment below the recognized standard of care, jeopardizes patient health, and delays patient recovery.
(e) To resolve this problem, it is the intent of the Legislature to enact this act in order to modernize and update state law and allow those in treatment to be protected and to receive modern medical treatment for a medical condition.
SEC. 2.

(2) For purposes of this chapter, “health care practitioner” means a person duly licensed and regulated under Division 2 (commencing with Section 500) of the Business and Professions Code, who is acting within the scope of practice of his or her license or certificate.
(b) The department shall develop a standard certification form for use by a health care practitioner. The form shall include, but not be limited to, a description of the alcoholism and drug abuse recovery or treatment services that an applicant needs.
(c) (1) The department shall adopt regulations, on or before July 1, 2018, to implement this section. The regulations shall be adopted in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).
(2) Notwithstanding the rulemaking provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, the department may, if it deems appropriate, implement, interpret, or make specific this section by means of provider bulletins, written guidelines, or similar instructions from the department only until the department adopts regulations.
SEC. 3.
Section 11834.026 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:
11834.026.
(a) As used in this section, “incidental medical services” means services that are in compliance with the community standard of practice and are not required to be performed in a licensed clinic or licensed health facility, as defined by Section 1200 or 1250, respectively, to address medical issues associated with either detoxification from alcohol or drugs or the provision of alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment services, including all of the following categories of services that the department shall further define by regulation:
(1) Obtaining medical histories.
(2) Monitoring health status to determine whether the health status warrants transfer of the patient in order to receive urgent or emergent care.
(3) Testing associated with detoxification from alcohol or drugs.
(4) Providing alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment services.
(5) Overseeing patient self-administered medications.
(6) Treating substance abuse disorders, including detoxification.
(b) Incidental medical services do not include the provision of general primary medical care.

(1) The facility, in the judgment of the department, has the ability to comply with the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable laws and regulations to meet the needs of a resident receiving incidental medical services pursuant to th licensed facility. A copy of the form provided by the department shall be signed by the physician and surgeon and maintained in the resident’s file at the facility.
(4) The resident has signed an admission agreement. The admission agreement, at a minimum, shall describe the incidental medical services that the facility may permit to be provided and shall state that the permitted incidental medical services will be provided by, or under the supervision of, a physician and surgeon. The department shall specify in regulations, at a minimum, the content and manner of providing the admission agreement, and any other information that the department deems appropriate. The facility shall maintain a copy of the signed admission agreement in the resident’s file.
(5) Once incidental medical services are initiated for a resident, the physician and surgeon and facility shall monitor the resident to ensure that the resident remains appropriate to receive those services. If the physician and surgeon determines that a change in the resident’s medical condition requires other medical services or that a higher level of care is required, the facility shall immediately arrange for the other medical services or higher level of care, as appropriate.
(6) The facility maintains in its files a copy of the relevant professional license or other written evidence of licensure to practice medicine or perform medical services in the state for the physician and surgeon and any other health care practitioner providing incidental medical services at the facility.

(f) Other than incidental medical services permitted to be provided or any urgent or emergent care required in the case of a life threatening emergency, this section does not authorize the provision at the premises of the facility of any medical or health care services or any other services that require a higher level of care than the care that may be provided within a licensed alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facility.
(g) This section does not require a residential treatment facility licensed by the department to provide incidental medical services or any services not otherwise permitted by law.
(h) (1) On or before July 1, 2018, the department shall adopt regulations to implement this section in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (Chapter 3.5 (commencing with Section 11340) of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code).

The director shall notify the licensee of the temporary suspension and the effective date of the temporary suspension and at the same time shall serve the provider with an accusation. Upon receipt of a notice of defense to the accusation by the licensee, the director shall, within 15 days, set the matter for hearing, and the hearing shall be held as soon as possible. The temporary suspension shall remain in effect until the time the hearing is completed and the director has made a final determination on the merits. However, the temporary suspension shall be deemed vacated if the director fails to make a final determination on the merits within 30 days after the department receives the proposed decision from the Office of Administrative Hearings.

Existing law requires the State Department of Health Care Services to license adult alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facilities, as defined. Existing law provides for the licensure and regulation of health care practitioners by various boards and other entities within the Department of Consumer Affairs, and prescribes the scope of practice of those health care practitioners.
This bill would authorize an adult alcoholism or drug abuse recovery or treatment facility that is licensed under those provisions to allow a licensed physician and surgeon or other health care practitioner, as defined, to provide incidental medical services, as defined, to a resident of the facility at the facility premises under specified limited circumstances, including, among others, that the resident signs an admission agreement and a physician and surgeon or other health care practitioner determines that it is medically appropriate for the resident to receive these services. The bill would require the department to establish and collect an additional fee from those facilities, in an amount sufficient to cover the department’s reasonable costs of regulating the provision of those services. The bill would require the department, on or before July 1, 2018, to adopt regulations to implement its provisions. The bill would also make related findings and declarations.

The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances of the County of Alameda. According to the Office of the Attorney General, there are currently nine regional human trafficking task forces. One of those task forces includes the County of Alameda, which makes it uniquely situated to implement a service model that would produce improved outcomes for youth victims of human trafficking by providing comprehensive intervention and rehabilitation services, as an alternative to traditional prosecution or incarceration, or both.

Existing law requires a person or entity that sells any quantity of specified substances to record the date of sale, product description, purchaser’s identification, and other specified information. Existing law requires the seller to retain this information for a period of 5 years and to present it upon demand by any law enforcement officer or authorized representative of the Attorney General. Existing law requires a person or entity that purchases any quantity of these specified substances to record the date of purchase, product description, and other specified information for a period of 3 years and to present it upon demand by any law enforcement officer or authorized representative of the Attorney General. A violation of these provisions is a crime.
This bill would add butane to the list of specified substances for which these requirements apply. The bill would also prohibit any person from purchasing more than 400 milliliters of butane in a calendar month. Because the bill would create a new crime, it would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

SECTION 1.
Section 23363.1 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
23363.1.
(a) A distilled spirits manufacturer’s license or a craft distiller’s license authorizes the licensee to conduct tastings of distilled spirits produced or bottled by, or produced or bottled for, the licensee, on or off the licensee’s premises.
(b) (1) Distilled spirits tastings may be conducted by the licensee off the licensee’s premises only for an event sponsored by a nonprofit organization. A distilled spirits manufacturer shall not sell or solicit sales of distilled spirits at an event. The sponsoring organization shall first obtain a permit from the department.
(2) For purposes of this subdivision, “nonprofit organization” does not include any community college or other institution of higher learning, as defined in the Education Code, nor does it include any officially recognized club, fraternity, or sorority, whether or not that entity is located on or off the institution’s campus.
(c) Tastings on the licensee’s premises shall be subject to the following conditions:
(1) The total volume of tastings of distilled spirits shall not exceed one and one-half ounces per individual per day.

SEC. 2.
Article 6 (commencing with Section 23500) is added to Chapter 3 of Division 9 of the Business and Professions Code, to read:
Article  6. Craft Distiller’s Licenses
23500.
This act shall be known, and may be referenced as, the Craft Distillers Act of 2015.
23501.
The Legislature hereby finds and declares all of the following:
(a) The regulation and licensing of the sale of alcoholic beverages in this state has operated for over 80 years under what is commonly referred to as the “three-tier system,” which generally prohibits vertical integration within the distilled spirits industry. This system has helped in protecting against undue marketing influences within the distilled spirits industry and assisted the goals of promoting temperance and reasonable regulation of the sale of distilled spirits within the state. In addition, this system has helped create thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in economic development within California.
(b) Small craft distillers have begun to operate in this state, and these craft distillers have begun to increase employment and provide jobs and economic development in various locations within the state.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature, in enacting this act, to encourage the development of the craft distilling industry within the state by enacting various limited exemptions to the general provisions of the three-tier system, while also continuing to uphold and support the three-tier system as the appropriate mechanism for regulating and licensing the sale of distilled spirits in California.
23502.
(a) The department may issue a craft distiller’s license to a person that has facilities and equipment for the purposes of, and is engaged in, the commercial manufacture of distilled spirits. The craft distiller’s license authorizes the licensee to do all of the following:
(1) Manufacture distilled spirits. A licensed craft distiller may manufacture up to 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per fiscal year (July 1 through June 30), excluding brandy the craft distiller manufactures or has manufactured for them pursuant to a brandy manufacturer license, as reported to the department in the manner prescribed by the department for the fiscal year prior to the date of submitting an application for the license.
(2) Package, rectify, mix, flavor, color, label, and export only those distilled spirits manufactured by the licensee.
(3) Only sell distilled spirits that are manufactured and packaged by the licensee solely to a wholesaler, manufacturer, winegrower, manufacturer’s agent, or rectifier that holds a license authorizing the sale of distilled spirits or to persons that take delivery of those distilled spirits within this state for delivery or use without the state.
(4) Deal in warehouse receipts.
(b) A craft distiller’s license shall not be issued to any person, any officer, director, employee, or agent of such person, or any person who is affiliated with, directly or indirectly, a person that manufactures or has manufactured for them more than 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per year within or without the state, excluding brandy it manufactures or has manufactured for them pursuant to a brandy manufacturer license, or to any person that is affiliated with, directly or indirectly, a wholesaler.
(c) (1) The fee for an original craft distiller’s license issued pursuant to this section shall be consistent with the distilled spirits manufacturer’s license and shall be adjusted pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 23320.
(2) The annual license fee for a craft distiller’s license shall be consistent with the distilled spirits manufacturer’s license and shall be adjusted pursuant to subdivisions (b) and (c) of Section 23320.
(3) All moneys collected as fees pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund as provided in Section 25761.
(d) A licensed craft distiller shall report to the department, at the time of renewal in the manner prescribed by the department, the amount of distilled spirits manufactured, excluding brandy manufactured by or for the licensee pursuant to a brandy manufacturer license, during the previous fiscal year. If the report to the department establishes that the licensee no longer qualifies to hold a craft distiller’s license, the department shall renew the license as a distilled spirits manufacturer’s license.
23504.
Notwithstanding any other provision, a licensed craft distiller may sell up to the equivalent of 2.25 liters in any combination of prepackaged containers per day per consumer of distilled spirits manufactured by the licensee at its premises to a consumer attending an instructional tasting conducted by the licensee on its licensed premises pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 23363.1.
23506.
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, a licensed craft distiller or one or more of its direct or indirect subsidiaries of which the licensed craft distiller owns not less than a 51-percent interest, who manufactures or produces, bottles, processes, imports, or sells distilled spirits under a craft distiller’s license or any other license issued pursuant to this division, or any officer or director of, or any person holding any interest in, those persons may serve as an officer or director of, and may hold the ownership of any interest or any financial or representative relationship in, any on-sale license, or the business conducted under that license, provided that, except in the case of a holder of on-sale general licenses for airplanes and duplicate on-sale general licenses for air common carriers, all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The on-sale licensee purchases all alcoholic beverages sold and served only from California wholesale licensees.
(2) The number of distilled spirits items by brand offered for sale by the on-sale licensee that are manufactured, produced, bottled, processed, imported, or sold by the licensed craft distiller or by the subsidiary of which the licensed craft distiller owns not less than 51 percent, or by any officer or director of, or by any person holding any interest in, those persons does not exceed 15 percent of the total distilled spirits items by brand listed and offered for sale by the on-sale licensee selling and serving that distilled spirit. Notwithstanding paragraph (1), distilled spirits sold pursuant to this provision may be purchased from a California licensed craft distiller so long as the distilled spirits purchased are produced or bottled by, or produced and packaged for, the same licensed craft distiller that holds an interest in the on-sale license and such direct sales do not involve more than two on-sale licenses in which the licensed craft distiller or any person holding an interest in the licensed craft distiller holds any interest, directly or indirectly, either individually or in combination or together with each other in the aggregate.
(3) None of the persons specified in this section may have any of the interests specified in this section in more than two on-sale licenses.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, a licensed craft distiller that has an interest in one or more on-sale retail licenses pursuant to this section may continue to hold that interest in the event the licensee no longer qualifies as a craft distiller, provided that the interest was first obtained at a time when the licensee did hold a craft distiller’s license pursuant to Section 23502.
(c) A craft distiller licensee may sell all beers, wines, brandies, or distilled spirits to consumers for consumption on the premises in a bona fide eating place as defined in Section 23038, which is located on the licensed premises or on premises owned by the licensee that are contiguous licensed premises and which is operated by and for the licensee, provided that any alcoholic beverage products not manufactured or produced by the licensee must be purchased from a licensed wholesaler. Beer, wine, and brandy may be used in the preparation of food and beverages in the bona fide public eating place for consumption on the premises.
23508.
(a) A licensed craft distiller may also have upon its licensed premises all beers, wines, and distilled spirits, regardless of source, for sale or service only to guests during private events or private functions not open to the general public. Alcoholic beverage products sold at the premises that are not manufactured or produced and bottled by, or manufactured or produced and packaged for, the licensed craft distiller shall be purchased by the licensed craft distiller only from a licensed wholesaler.
(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this division, in the event that the licensee no longer qualifies as a craft distiller due to the amount of distilled spirits reported pursuant to Section 23502, the licensee may continue to hold the privileges granted by this section.
SEC. 3.
Section 23771 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:

SEC. 4.
Section 23772 of the Business and Professions Code is amended to read:
23772.
(a) A distilled spirits manufacturer’s or distilled spirits manufacturer’s agent’s license shall not be held by any person that holds any ownership or interest, directly or indirectly, by stock ownership, interlocking directors, trusteeship, loan, mortgage, or lien on any personal or real property, or otherwise, in any craft distiller’s, distilled spirits wholesaler’s, rectifier’s, or retailer’s license.
(b) The provisions of this section shall not apply to the financial or representative relationship between a manufacturer, winegrower, manufacturer’s agent, rectifier, distiller, bottler, importer, or wholesaler, or any officer, director, or agent of that person, and a person holding only one of the following types of licenses:
(1) On-sale general license for a bona fide club.
(2) Club license (issued under Article 4 (commencing at Section 23425) of Chapter 3).
(3) Veterans’ club license (issued under Article 5 (commencing at Section 23450) of Chapter 3).

The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act contains various provisions regulating the application for, the issuance of, the suspension of, and the conditions imposed upon, alcoholic beverage licenses by the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. Existing law provides for various annual fees for the issuance of alcoholic beverage licenses, depending upon the type of license issued.
This bill, the Craft Distillers Act of 2015, would authorize the department to issue a craft distiller’s license to manufacture distilled spirits, subject to specified conditions, including that the licensee manufacture no more than 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits per fiscal year, excluding brandy the craft distiller manufactures or has manufactured for them. The bill would allow the craft distiller’s licensee to sell distilled spirits to specified consumers, to own interests in on-sale retail licenses, and to sell beer, wines, brandies, and distilled spirits to consumers for consumption on the premises of a bona fide eating place, as provided. The bill would impose an original fee and an annual renewal fee for the license, which would be deposited in the Alcohol Beverage Control Fund.
The Alcoholic Beverage Control Act authorizes a licensed distilled spirits manufacturer to conduct tastings of distilled spirits produced or bottled by, or produced or bottled for, the licensee, on the licensed premises, under specified conditions, including that tasting not be given in the form of a cocktail or mixed drink.
This bill would extend that authorization to a licensed craft distiller and would revise the tasting conditions by allowing a tasting to be given in the form of a cocktail or mixed drink.
Existing law prohibits a distilled spirits manufacturer’s or distilled spirits manufacturer’s agent’s license from being held by a person that holds any ownership or interest in any distilled spirits wholesaler’s, rectifier’s, or retailer’s license, as specified.
This bill would additionally prohibit a distilled spirits manufacturer’s or distilled spirits manufacturer’s agent’s license from being held by a person that holds any ownership or interest in a craft distiller’s license.

SECTION 1.
Section 2079.13 of the Civil Code is amended to read:
2079.13.
As used in Sections 2079.7, and 2079.14 to 2079.24, inclusive, the following terms have the following meanings:

The agent in the real property transaction bears responsibility for his or her associate licensees who perform as agents of the agent. When an associate licensee owes a duty to any principal, or to any buyer or seller who is not a principal, in a real property transaction, that duty is equivalent to the duty owed to that party by the broker for whom the associate licensee functions.
(c) “Buyer” means a transferee in a real property transaction, and includes a person who executes an offer to purchase real property from a seller through an agent, or who seeks the services of an agent in more than a casual, transitory, or preliminary manner, with the object of entering into a real property transaction. “Buyer” includes vendee or lessee.

(g) “Listing agent” means a person who has obtained a listing of real property to act as an agent for compensation.
(h) “Listing price” is the amount expressed in dollars specified in the listing for which the seller is willing to sell the real property through the listing agent.
(i) “Offering price” is the amount expressed in dollars specified in an offer to purchase for which the buyer is willing to buy the real property.
(j) “Offer to purchase” means a written contract executed by a buyer acting through a selling agent that becomes the contract for the sale of the real property upon acceptance by the seller.
(k) “Real property” means any estate specified by subdivision (1) or (2) of Section 761 in property that constitutes or is improved with one to four dwelling units, any commercial real property, any leasehold in these types of property exceeding one year’s duration, and mobilehomes, when offered for sale or sold through an agent pursuant to the authority contained in Section 10131.6 of the Business and Professions Code.
(l) “Real property transaction” means a transaction for the sale of real property in which an agent is employed by one or more of the principals to act in that transaction, and includes a listing or an offer to purchase.
(m) “Sell,” “sale,” or “sold” refers to a transaction for the transfer of real property from the seller to the buyer, and includes exchanges of real property between the seller and buyer, transactions for the creation of a real property sales contract within the meaning of Section 2985, and transactions for the creation of a leasehold exceeding one year’s duration.
(n) “Seller” means the transferor in a real property transaction, and includes an owner who lists real property with an agent, whether or not a transfer results, or who receives an offer to purchase real property of which he or she is the owner from an agent on behalf of another. “Seller” includes both a vendor and a lessor.
(o) “Selling agent” means a listing agent who acts alone, or an agent who acts in cooperation with a listing agent, and who sells or finds and obtains a buyer for the real property, or an agent who locates property for a buyer or who finds a buyer for a property for which no listing exists and presents an offer to purchase to the seller.
(p) “Subagent” means a person to whom an agent delegates agency powers as provided in Article 5 (commencing with Section 2349) of Chapter 1 of Title 9. However, “subagent” does not include an associate licensee who is acting under the supervision of an agent in a real property transaction.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 1369 of the Penal Code is amended to read:
1369.
Except as stated in subdivision (g), a trial by court or jury of the question of mental competence shall proceed in the following order:
(a) The court shall appoint a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, and any other expert the court may deem appropriate, to examine the defendant. In any case where the defendant or the defendant’s counsel informs the court that the defendant is not seeking a finding of mental incompetence, the court shall appoint two psychiatrists, licensed psychologists, or a combination thereof. One of the psychiatrists or licensed psychologists may be named by the defense and one may be named by the prosecution. The examining psychiatrists or licensed psychologists shall evaluate the nature of the defendant’s mental disorder, if any, the defendant’s ability or inability to understand the nature of the criminal proceedings or assist counsel in the conduct of a defense in a rational manner as a result of a mental disorder and, if within the scope of their licenses and appropriate to their opinions, whether or not treatment with antipsychotic medication is medically appropriate for the defendant and whether antipsychotic medication is likely to restore the defendant to mental competence. If an examining psychologist is of the opinion that antipsychotic medication may be medically appropriate for the defendant and that the defendant should be evaluated by a psychiatrist to determine if antipsychotic medication is medically appropriate, the psychologist shall inform the court of this opinion and his or her recommendation as to whether a psychiatrist should examine the defendant. The examining psychiatrists or licensed psychologists shall also address the issues of whether the defendant has capacity to make decisions regarding antipsychotic medication and whether the defendant is a danger to self or others. If the defendant is examined by a psychiatrist and the psychiatrist forms an opinion as to whether or not treatment with antipsychotic medication is medically appropriate, the psychiatrist shall inform the court of his or her opinions as to the likely or potential side effects of the medication, the expected efficacy of the medication, possible alternative treatments, and whether it is medically appropriate to administer antipsychotic medication in the county jail. If it is suspected the defendant is developmentally disabled, the court shall appoint the director of the regional center for the developmentally disabled established under Division 4.5 (commencing with Section 4500) of the Welfare and Institutions Code, or the designee of the director, to examine the defendant. The court may order the developmentally disabled defendant to be confined for examination in a residential facility or state hospital.
The regional center director shall recommend to the court a suitable residential facility or state hospital. Prior to issuing an order pursuant to this section, the court shall consider the recommendation of the regional center director. While the person is confined pursuant to order of the court under this section, he or she shall be provided with necessary care and treatment.
(b) (1) The counsel for the defendant shall offer evidence in support of the allegation of mental incompetence.
(2) If the defense declines to offer any evidence in support of the allegation of mental incompetence, the prosecution may do so.

Existing law prohibits a person from being tried or adjudged to punishment while that person is mentally incompetent. Existing law establishes a process by which a defendant’s mental competency is evaluated, which includes requiring the court to appoint a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist, and any other expert the court may deem appropriate.
This bill would, on or before July 1, 2017, require the State Department of State Hospitals, through the use of a workgroup representing specified groups, to adopt guidelines for education and training standards for a psychiatrist or licensed psychologist to be considered for appointment by the court. The bill would provide that if there is no reasonably available expert who meets the guidelines, the court shall have discretion to appoint an expert who does not meet the guidelines.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The heading of Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 10600) of Part 2 of Division 2 of Title 2 of the Government Code is amended to read:
CHAPTER  5. Joint Pension Administration and Sustainability Committee
SEC. 2.
Section 10600 of the Government Code is amended to read:
10600.
(a) The Legislature finds that the retirement of officers and employees of the state, school districts, and many cities, counties, and public jurisdictions in the state, is provided under several independently administered and highly complex systems that all share the distinctive feature of being organized to achieve results over the 30- to 40-year time frame that corresponds to the typical length of workers’ careers.
(b) These pension systems are organized and administered under highly technical statutes and protected by constitutional provisions. Certain provisions in the California Constitution, which are patterned upon the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, commonly known as ERISA, require that pension funds be invested for the sole interests of the beneficiaries and for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits and establish a standard of conduct that makes persons managing the pension systems fiduciaries with respect to how they manage the money.
(c) Development and change in these systems are interrelated and have important long-range implications both with respect to cost and to the retirement expectations of public employees and also the state and national economy, as the ability of persons to enter into retirement with a source of income to spend on goods and services in retirement provides an important source of demand for goods and services during economic downturns to assist eventual recovery as well as assisting the ability of public entities to transition their workforces to younger entry level employees as older workers are able to retire even during an economic downturn, thereby creating openings.
(d) The Legislature recognizes the need to coordinate this change and development and for continuing study and analysis of these systems and legislation affecting them.
(e) Therefore, it is the desire of the Legislature to provide for such continuing study and analysis by a joint legislative committee.
SEC. 3.

The Dental Practice Act provides for the licensure and regulation of dentists by the Dental Board of California. That act authorizes a committee of the board to evaluate all suggestions or requests for regulatory changes related to the committee and to hold informational hearings in order to report and make appropriate recommendations to the board, after consultation with departmental legal counsel and the board’s chief executive officer. The act requires a committee to include in any report regarding a proposed regulatory change, at a minimum, the specific language or the proposed change or changes and the reasons therefor, and any facts supporting the need for the change.
The act governs the use of general anesthesia, conscious sedation, and oral conscious sedation for pediatric and adult patients. The act makes it unprofessional conduct for a licensee to fail to report the death of a patient, or removal of a patient to a hospital or emergency center for medical treatment, that is related to a dental procedure, as specified. The act also makes it unprofessional conduct for any dentist to fail to obtain the written informed consent of a patient prior to administering general anesthesia or conscious sedation. In the case of a minor, the act requires that the consent be obtained from the child’s parent or guardian.
This bill, which would be known as “Caleb’s Law,” would require the board, on or before January 1, 2017, to provide to the Legislature a report on whether current statutes and regulations for the administration and monitoring of pediatric anesthesia in dentistry provide adequate protection for pediatric dental patients and would require the board to make the report publicly available on the board’s Internet Web site. The bill also would require the board to provide a report on pediatric deaths related to general anesthesia in dentistry at the time of its sunset review by the appropriate policy committees of the Legislature.
This bill would require that the report of the death of a patient, or removal of a patient to a hospital or emergency center for medical treatment, be on a form or forms approved by the board and that the report include specified information. The bill authorizes the board to assess a penalty on any licensee who fails to make the required report.
This bill, with regard to obtaining written informed consent for general anesthesia or conscious sedation in the case of a minor, would require that the written informed consent include specified information regarding anesthesia, as provided.

Existing law authorizes the Attorney General or a district attorney to make a written application to a judge of a superior court for an order permitting the interception of wire communication and electronic communication, as defined. Existing law permits an application to be made informally and granted orally if an emergency situation exists, and other factors are present. Existing law conditions the granting of an oral approval on the filing of a written application by midnight of the second full court day after the oral approval is made. Existing law prohibits a communication interception from lasting for longer than 30 days. Existing law permits an extension of the original order, not to exceed 30 days, upon a showing that there is continued probable cause that the information sought is likely to be obtained under the extension.
This bill would prohibit a person, other than a provider of electronic or wire communication service for specified purposes, from installing or using a pen register or a trap and trace device, as defined. The bill would authorize a peace officer to make a written application to a magistrate for an order permitting the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and trace device. The bill would require the magistrate to enter an ex parte order authorizing the installation and use of a pen register or a trap and trace device only in specified circumstances and would permit the magistrate to question the peace officer pertaining to the need for the information. The bill would also permit an application to be made informally and granted orally if an emergency situation exists, and other factors are present. The bill would condition the grant of an oral approval on the filing of a written application by midnight of the second full court day after the pen register or trap and trace device is installed. The bill would prohibit the installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device for longer than 60 days. The bill would permit an extension of the original order, not to exceed 60 days, upon a showing that there is continued probable cause that the information sought is likely to be obtained under the extension. The bill would clarify that any location information obtained by a pen register or a track and trace device is limited to the information that can be determined from the telephone number.
The bill would make the prohibited installation or use of a pen register or a trap and trace device punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,500, or by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding 1 year, or by imprisonment in state prison for offenders with specified prior convictions, or by both that fine and imprisonment. By creating a new crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1) Computer science education is not only about access to computers. It is about innovation and development of technology. Computer science education builds pupils’ computational and critical thinking skills, which enables them to create, and not simply use, the next generation of technological tools. This fundamental knowledge is needed to prepare pupils for the 21st century regardless of their ultimate field of study or occupation.
(2) Computer science drives job creation and innovation throughout our state’s economy. Providing access to computer science education is a critical step for ensuring that California remains competitive in the global economy and strengthens its cybersecurity. Last year, there were over 600,000 technology jobs open across the United States, and, by 2018, 51 percent of all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) jobs are projected to be in computer science-related fields. In California, there are currently 86,436 open computing jobs, which is four times the average demand rate in California.
(3) Computing occupations make up two-thirds of all projected new jobs in STEM fields, making computer science one of the most in-demand college degrees. However, California only had 3,525 computer science graduates in 2014 with only 15 percent female graduates.
(4) There are fewer advanced placement (AP) examinations taken in computer science than in any other STEM subject area. Of the high school pupils in California who took the AP computer science examination in 2015, only 26 percent were female, only 973 were Latino, and only 148 were African American. Only 242 schools in California, or 16 percent of California schools with AP programs, offered the AP computer science course in the 2013–14 school year.
(5) President Obama’s Computer Science for All initiative builds on the momentum at the state and local level. The President’s upcoming budget proposes funding for the United States Department of Education, available over three years, for states to increase access to computer science education in elementary and secondary education classrooms. Under the program, states would submit comprehensive five-year “Computer Science for All” plans in order to be eligible for federal funding, and every state with a well-designed strategy would receive funds. In addition to state-level grants, the budget will also dedicate funds for competitive grants specifically for leading districts to execute ambitious computer science education expansion efforts for all pupils, including traditionally underrepresented pupils, with those efforts to serve as models for national replication.
(6) However, access to computer science education for all pupils is still a challenge, especially for underrepresented communities. Only one out of four K–12 schools teaches any computer science, leaving 75 percent of pupils today without the opportunity to develop skills that could help them thrive in the future.
(7) Exposure to computer science at a young age has the potential to address the diversity gap in computer science fields. Girls who take AP computer science in high school are 10 times more likely to major in computer science in college. African American and Latino pupils who take this course in high school are over seven times more likely to major in this field.
(8) A Google-Gallup survey found that nine out of 10 parents say they want computer science taught in their schools, and the majority of parents and teachers believe it should be required learning for 21st century pupils.
(9) Computer science has often been confused with broader technology education in schools. California should adopt distinct standards for computer science focused on both the creation and use of software and computing technologies at all levels of K–12 education.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that all pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12, inclusive, have access to computer science education, with a strong focus on pupils underrepresented in computer science, including girls, low-income and underserved school districts, and rural and urban school districts.
(c) It is the intent of the Legislature that the only predetermined outcome be to increase access to computer science in California schools and to account for disparate views as recommendations are provided.
SEC. 2.
Chapter 19 (commencing with Section 53310) is added to Part 28 of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Education Code, to read:

(i) The franchisee is convicted of a felony or any other criminal misconduct which is relevant to the operation of the franchise;
(j) The franchisee fails to pay any franchise fees or other amounts due to the franchisor or its affiliate within five days after receiving written notice that such fees are overdue; or
(k) The franchisor makes a reasonable determination that continued operation of the franchise by the franchisee will result in an imminent danger to public health or safety.
(l) If the franchise expressly permits termination under such circumstances, there is a lawful termination or nonrenewal of a separate motor fuel franchise governed by provisions of the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (15 U.S.C. Secs. 2801 to 2807, inclusive) that is operated by the franchisee or affiliate of the franchisee located at the same business premises if both franchises are granted by the same franchisor or an affiliate of the franchisor. “Affiliate” shall have the same meaning as set forth in subdivision (k) of Section 31005.5 of the Corporations Code.

As soon as practicable after the receipt of the proposed transferee’s application, the franchisor shall notify, in writing, the franchisee and the proposed transferee of any additional information or documentation necessary to complete the transfer application.

Actual Output
The California Franchise Relations Act sets forth certain requirements related to the termination, nonrenewal, and transfer of franchises between a franchisor, subfranchisor, and franchisee, as those terms are defined.
That act, except as otherwise provided, prohibits a franchisor from terminating a franchise prior to the expiration of its term, except for good cause, which includes, but is not limited to, the failure of the franchisee to comply with any lawful requirement of the franchise agreement after being given notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure the failure within 30 days.
This bill would instead limit good cause to the failure of the franchisee to substantially comply with the lawful requirements of the franchise agreement imposed on the franchisee after being given notice at least 60 days in advance and would require that the period for a reasonable opportunity to cure the failure be no less than 60 days from the date of the notice of noncompliance. The bill would prohibit the period for curing the failure from exceeding 75 days, except as specified. The bill also would allow immediate termination of a specified separate motor vehicle franchise under specified circumstances.
This bill would make it unlawful for a franchise agreement to prevent a franchisee from selling or transferring a franchise, all or substantially all of the assets of the franchise business, as defined, or a controlling or noncontrolling interest in the franchise business, to another person, provided that the person is qualified under the franchisor’s then-existing and reasonable standards for approval of new or renewing franchisees, as specified, and the parties comply with specified transfer provisions. The bill would prohibit a sale, transfer, or assignment of a franchise, all or substantially all of the assets of a franchise business, or a controlling or noncontrolling interest in the franchise business, without the franchisor’s written consent, but would prohibit that consent from being withheld unless the buyer, transferee, or assignor does not meet standards for new or renewing franchisees or the parties fail to meet specified transfer provisions.
This bill would require the franchisee, prior to the sale, assignment, or transfer of a franchise, all or substantially all of the assets of a franchise business, as defined, or a controlling or noncontrolling interest in the franchise business, to another person, to notify the franchisor of the franchisee’s intent to sell, transfer, or assign the franchise or its assets or interest, as specified, and would require the notice to be in writing and include specified information. The bill would require the franchisor, within a specified period, to notify the franchisee of the approval or disapproval of the proposed sale, assignment, or transfer of the franchise, and would require the notice to be in writing and be delivered by courier to the franchisee or sent by receipted mail. The bill would require the franchisor to communicate the franchisor’s standards for approval of new or renewing franchisees, as specified. The bill would deem a proposed sale, assignment, or transfer approved, unless disapproved by the franchisor, as specified.
The act requires a franchisor that terminates or fails to renew a franchise, other than in accordance with specified provisions of law, to offer to repurchase from the franchisee the franchisee’s resalable current inventory, as specified.
This bill would repeal those provisions and would, with certain exceptions, require the franchisor, upon a lawful termination or nonrenewal of a franchisee, to purchase from the franchisee at the value of price paid, minus depreciation, all inventory, supplies, equipment, fixtures, and furnishings purchased or paid for under the franchise agreement, as specified. The bill would not require a franchisor to purchase assets to which the franchisee cannot or does not provide clear title and possession.
This bill would entitle a franchisee to receive from the franchisor the fair market value of the franchise business and assets, as well as resulting damages, if a franchisor terminates or fails to renew a franchise in violation of the act. The bill would provide for injunctive relief in the event of a violation or threatened violation of these provisions.
The bill would limit its application to a franchise agreement entered into or renewed on or after January 1, 2016, or to franchises of an indefinite duration that may be terminated without cause.

Under existing law, the State Department of Public Health licenses, registers, and regulates clinical laboratories and various clinical laboratory personnel. Existing law prohibits a person from performing a clinical laboratory test or examination classified as waived under the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 unless the test or examination is performed under the overall operation and administration of a laboratory director and the test or examination is performed by any one of specified professionals and others, including a licensed physician and surgeon or pharmacist. Existing law establishes the Office of AIDS in the department and defines human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the etiologic agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Existing law authorizes an HIV counselor who receives specified training and works in specified counseling and testing sites to perform HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or combined HIV/HCV tests, including performing skin punctures for purposes of withdrawing blood for purposes of these tests, as specified.
This bill would authorize a hepatitis C counselor who meets specified requirements to perform an HCV test and to order and report HCV test results. The bill would authorize the State Department of Public Health to implement and administer these provisions by means of a bulletin or similar instructions. The bill would also add hepatitis C counselors performing an HCV test to the list of professionals authorized to perform a test or examination classified as waived under the federal Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, as specified.

(a)
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(1)
The Regents of the University of California endorsed, on May 21, 2015, the framework for long-term funding agreed upon by the Governor and the President of the University, pursuant to which tuition will not increase in the 2015–16 and 2016–17 academic years and the university will implement reforms to reduce the cost structure of the university and improve access, quality, and outcomes.
(2)
The reforms included in the framework endorsed by the Regents will create capacity for all campuses of the university to serve more resident students, including by easing transfer from the community colleges, reducing the amount of time it takes students to complete programs, and using technology and data to improve allocation of available resources.
(3)
In addition to the funds included in this appropriation and those described in the framework, other funds, including existing resources that can be redirected to higher priorities, such as those currently being used to provide financial aid to nonresident students, are also available to enable more resident students to enter the university at all of its campuses.
(4)
Furthermore, it is the intent of the Legislature that those funds generated by an increase in the number of nonresident students enrolled in the 2015–16 academic year, compared to the number of nonresident students enrolled in the 2014–15 academic year, and increases in nonresident supplemental tuition, as approved by the Regents on May 21, 2015, be used specifically to support an increase in the number of resident students enrolled.
(b)
To address immediate needs, the university is expected to enroll, no later than the 2016–17 academic year, at least 5,000 more resident undergraduate students than the number enrolled in the 2014–15 academic year.
(c)
If the Regents provide sufficient evidence to the Director of Finance on or before May 1, 2016, to demonstrate that the university will satisfy the expectation enumerated in subdivision (b), the Director of Finance shall increase this appropriation by $25,000,000 and notify the Joint Legislative Budget Committee.

No later than December 10, 2015, the Regents of the University of California shall report to the Director of Finance and, in conformity with Section 9795 of the Government Code, to the Legislature, all of the following:

The Legislature finds and declares that many state employees hold positions with comparable scope of responsibilities, complexity, breadth of job functions, experience requirements, and other relevant factors to those employees designated to be in the Senior Management Group pursuant to existing Regents policy.

Therefore, at a minimum, the Regents shall, when considering compensation for any employee designated to be in the Senior Management Group, use a market reference zone that includes state employees.

At a minimum, the Regents shall identify all comparable positions from the lists included in subdivision (l) of Section 8 of Article III of the California Constitution and Article 1 (commencing with Section 11550) of Chapter 6 of Part 1 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code.

Existing law, except as specified, prohibits any state agency from expending funds appropriated for design-build projects until the Department of Finance and the State Public Works Board have approved performance criteria for the project.
This bill would include among the exceptions to those provisions amounts appropriated for projects at the Salton Sea.
Existing law requires either the Director of General Services or the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to notify the State Public Works Board regarding the method to be used for selecting a design-build entity, prior to advertising the design-build project.
This bill would, for purposes of projects at the Salton Sea, instead require the Director of the Department of Water Resources to notify the California Water Commission regarding the method to be used for selecting a design-build entry, prior to advertising a design-build project.
The bill would make other conforming changes.
Existing law authorizes any public corporation, as defined, and specified private corporations to apply for the privilege of establishing, operating, and maintaining a foreign-trade zone in accordance with federal law, and provides that any public or private corporation whose application is granted pursuant to federal law is authorized to establish, operate, and maintain a foreign-trade zone, subject to specified conditions. Existing law also authorizes a public corporation, if authorized to establish, operate, and maintain a foreign trade zone, to provide the United States with indemnity or assurance and to deposit sums of money with the United States as requested.
This bill would combine and reorganize these provisions and would repeal that indemnity and assurance provision.

Section 2.5 of this bill incorporates amendments to Section 4735 of the Civil Code proposed by both this bill and Assembly Bill 349. It shall only become operative if (1) both bills are enacted and become effective, (2) each bill amends Section 4735 of the Civil Code, and (3) this bill is enacted after Assembly Bill 349, in which case Section 2 of this bill shall not become operative.
SEC. 4.
This act is an urgency statute necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety within the meaning of Article IV of the Constitution and shall go into immediate effect. The facts constituting the necessity are:
California is in a state of emergency because of the continued drought. In response, Governor Brown issued Executive Order B-29-15, ordering a 25 percent statewide reduction in urban water consumption. Because residential landscaping accounts for 35 percent or more of the average urban water usage statewide, many homeowners have voluntarily ceased watering landscaping in order to assist with the drought emergency. However, some homeowners associations have interpreted existing law to allow them to fine homeowners who voluntarily cease using potable water on their landscaping if the homeowners association itself is using a de minimis amount of recycled water on common areas. This is directly contrary to the state’s need to conserve the precious and dwindling water supplied for urban, agricultural, and environmental needs.

The Davis-Stirling Common Interest Development Act governs the management and operation of common interest developments. Existing law provides that, unless otherwise provided in the common interest development declaration, the association is responsible for repairing, replacing, or maintaining the common area, other than exclusive use common area, and the owner of each separate interest is responsible for maintaining that separate interest and any exclusive use common area appurtenant to that interest. Existing law makes void and unenforceable any provision of the governing documents or architectural or landscaping guidelines or policies that prohibits use of low water-using plants, or prohibits or restricts compliance with water-efficient landscape ordinances or regulations on the use of water, as specified.
Existing law also prohibits an association, except an association that uses recycled water for landscape irrigation, from imposing a fine or assessment on separate interest owners for reducing or eliminating watering of vegetation or lawns during any period for which the Governor has declared a state of emergency or the local government has declared a local emergency due to drought.
This bill would revise that exception to instead authorize the imposition of a fine or assessment against the owner of a separate interest that receives recycled water from a retail water supplier, as defined, and fails to use that recycled water for landscaping irrigation.
This bill would incorporate additional changes to Section 4735 of the Civil Code proposed by AB 349 that would become operative if this bill and AB 349 are enacted and this bill is enacted last.
This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as an urgency statute.

(b) Each county may develop a protocol that may be used as a guideline by persons performing autopsies on children to assist coroners and other persons who perform autopsies in the identification of child abuse or neglect, in the determination of whether child abuse or neglect contributed to death or whether child abuse or neglect had occurred prior to but was not the actual cause of death, and in the proper written reporting procedures for child abuse or neglect, including the designation of the cause and mode of death.
(c) In developing an interagency child death review team and an autopsy protocol, each county, working in consultation with local members of the California State Coroner’s Association and county child abuse prevention coordinating councils, may solicit suggestions and final comments from persons, including, but not limited to, the following:

SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which amends Section 11174.32 of the Penal Code, imposes a limitation on the public’s right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies within the meaning of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution. Pursuant to that constitutional provision, the Legislature makes the following findings to demonstrate the interest protected by this limitation and the need for protecting that interest:
In order to facilitate the voluntary disclosure of confidential information to child death review teams and to retain the confidentiality of that information, the limitations on the public’s right of access imposed by Section 1 of this act are necessary.

Existing law authorizes a county to establish an interagency child death review team to assist local agencies in identifying and reviewing suspicious child deaths and facilitating communication among persons who perform autopsies and the various persons and agencies involved in child abuse or neglect cases. Existing law requires records that are exempt from disclosure to 3rd parties pursuant to state or federal law to remain exempt from disclosure when they are in the possession of a child death review team.
This bill would authorize the voluntary disclosure of specified information, including mental health records, criminal history information, and child abuse reports, by an individual or agency to an interagency child death review team. The bill would provide that written or oral information disclosed to a child death review team pursuant to these provisions would remain confidential, and would not be subject to disclosure or discovery by a 3rd party unless otherwise required by law.
Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.
This bill would make legislative findings to that effect.

The existing Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Act defines the term “venereal disease” to mean syphilis, gonorrhea, chancroid, lymphopathia venereum, granuloma inguinale, and chlamydia. Existing law requires the State Department of Public Health to develop and review plans and participate in a program for the prevention and control of venereal disease, and authorizes the department to establish, maintain, and subsidize clinics, dispensaries, and prophylactic stations for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of venereal disease.
This bill would delete the term “venereal disease” and would instead use the term “sexually transmitted diseases” (STDs), which would be defined as diseases that are primarily transmitted through sexual contact. The bill would require the department, to the extent funds are appropriated by the Legislature, to allocate grants to local health jurisdictions for STD outreach, screening, and other core services. The bill would target and prioritize the allocation of funds to counties based on population and incidence of STDs and would require the allocation of funds to targeted counties to balance the need to spread funding to as many counties as possible and the need to provide meaningful services to each funded county. The bill would make specified mandates and accountability measures applicable to the county when providing the outreach, screening, and other core services.
This bill would provide that the department, in awarding funds pursuant to these provisions, may authorize innovative and impactful outreach, screening, and other core services, such as voluntary screening of inmates and wards of county adult and juvenile corrections facilities, and use of state-of-the-art testing modalities. The bill would require the department to use the accountability measures developed under the bill in order to monitor the activities funded by the bill and would limit the department’s expenditures on administrative costs to no more than 10% of the funds appropriated by the Legislature for this purpose.
The bill would also delete obsolete provisions and make conforming changes.

(a)The Natural Resources Agency shall establish a grant program for projects on or adjacent to riparian corridors that furthers the regulatory purposes of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (Division 25.5 (commencing with Section 38500) of the Health and Safety Code) and meets the requirements of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund Investment Plan and Communities Revitalization Act (Chapter 4.1 (commencing with Section 39710) of Part 2 of Division 26 of the Health and Safety Code).
(b)To be eligible for funding under the program, a project shall demonstrate that it will achieve a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases. In selecting projects for funding, the Natural Resources Agency, in consultation with the State Air Resources Board, shall consider the extent to which a project reduces emissions of greenhouse gases.
(c)In evaluating grant applications for funding, the Natural Resources Agency shall, in addition to prioritizing projects pursuant to subdivision (b), consider the extent to which a project provides the greatest level of the following cobenefits:
(1)Recreational access to and improved human interaction with a river or riparian corridor, especially in urban corridors and park-starved communities.
(2)Improved transportation mobility, especially pedestrian, bicycle, and public transit.
(3)Economic viability of the surrounding community by promoting appropriate development, especially in an urban setting.
(4)Development of visitor-serving and interpretive facilities.
(5)Access and development of pocket parks, community gardens, demonstration gardens, and other urban greening.
(6)Species protections and the protection of habitat strongholds, including improved wildlife corridors.
(7)Improved resiliency in the face of unavoidable impacts from climate change.
(8)Improved water supply, flood protection, and water quality, including the water quality of impaired water bodies through river restoration.
(9)Job training and workforce development, especially projects that involve disadvantaged youth and veterans.
(10)Improved stormwater retention.
(d)Projects receiving funding pursuant to this chapter shall also be consistent with both of the following:
(1)The California Water Action Plan published by the Governor.
(2)The Safeguarding California Plan published by the Natural Resources Agency.
(e)Projects receiving funding pursuant to this chapter for flood protection shall be consistent, as applicable, with Chapter 4 (commencing with Section 8400) of Part 2 of Division 5, Part 6 (commencing with Section 9600) of Division 5, and Part 9 (commencing with Section 12980) of Division 6, of the Water Code.
(f)The Natural Resources Agency shall also prioritize funding pursuant to this chapter for projects with the following characteristics:
(1)Are consistent with a parkway, greenway, or urban greening plan.
(2)Leverage moneys from the Water Quality, Supply, and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014, approved by the voters as Proposition 1 at the November 4, 2014, statewide general election.
(3)Provide recreational access and opportunities to major metropolitan areas of the state, including those that are relatively underserved by parks.
5848.
The CalRIVER fund is hereby created in the State Treasury to be administered by the Natural Resources Agency. The moneys in the CalRIVER Fund, upon appropriation by the Legislature, shall be expended by the Natural Resources Agency in accordance with this chapter. The Legislature may transfer moneys to the fund from bond proceeds and special funds, including, but not limited to, the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, created by Section 16428.8 of the Government Code.
5849.
The secretary shall develop regulations, criteria, or procedural guidelines for the implementation of this chapter.

Existing law, as part of the hazardous waste control law, requires a facility handling hazardous waste to obtain a hazardous waste facilities permit from the Department of Toxic Substances Control. Existing law requires the department to impose certain conditions on each hazardous waste facilities permit and authorizes the department to impose other conditions on a hazardous waste facilities permit, as specified. A violation of the hazardous waste control law is a crime.
This bill would require the department, within 90 days of receiving a renewal application for a hazardous waste facilities permit, to hold a public meeting for specified purposes in or near the community in which the hazardous waste facility is located.
Existing law prohibits the department from issuing or renewing a permit to operate a hazardous waste facility unless the owner or operator of the facility establishes and maintains financial assurances.
This bill would require the department to review the financial assurances required to operate a hazardous waste facility at least once every 5 years. If the department’s review finds the financial assurances for a facility to be inadequate, the bill would require the department to notify the owner or operator of the facility and would require the owner or operator to update and adopt adequate financial assurances within 90 days.
Because a violation of the bill’s requirements would be a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law establishes various plans and programs to preserve, protect, and rehabilitate lands adjacent to rivers in the state.
The California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 designates the State Air Resources Board as the state agency charged with monitoring and regulating sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The state board is required to adopt a statewide greenhouse gas emissions limit equivalent to the statewide greenhouse gas emissions level in 1990 to be achieved by 2020.
This bill would require the Natural Resources Agency to establish a grant program for projects on or adjacent to riparian corridors that, among other things, furthers the regulatory purposes of the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 and to consider the extent to which a project reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and provides the greatest level of specified cobenefits. The bill would create the CalRIVER Fund in the State Treasury, with moneys in the fund to be available upon appropriation to implement the grant program.
The bill would require the secretary of the agency to develop regulations, criteria, or procedural guidelines for the implementation of the grant program.

Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, establishes the California State Board of Pharmacy and sets forth its powers and duties, including, but not limited to, the licensing and regulation of pharmacists. Existing law makes a knowing violation of these provisions a crime.
Existing law requires every prescription, as defined, to include a legible, clear notice of the condition or purpose for which the drug is prescribed, if requested by the patient. Existing law prohibits a pharmacist from dispensing any prescription unless it is in a specified container that is correctly labeled to include, among other information, the condition or purpose for which the drug was prescribed, if the condition or purpose is indicated on the prescription.
This bill would instead require that every prescription include a legible, clear notice of the condition or purpose for which the drug is prescribed, and would authorize the prescriber or patient to request that this information not be included in the prescription container label. This bill would, similarly, require that every prescription container be correctly labeled to include that information, unless omission of that information has been requested by the prescriber or patient.
By establishing these additional requirements, the knowing violation of which would be a crime, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason.
Existing law, the Pharmacy Law, requires an oral or an electronic data transmission prescription to be reduced to writing by the pharmacist and to be filled by, or under the direction of, the pharmacist.

This bill would make nonsubstantive changes to those provisions.

Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law establishes community college districts throughout the state, and authorizes them to operate campuses and provide instruction to students.
The Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Act requires a mandated reporter, which includes a specified employee or administrator of a community college district, to report whenever he or she, in his or her professional capacity or within the scope of his or her employment, has knowledge of or has observed a child whom the mandated reporter knows or reasonably suspects has been the victim of child abuse or neglect.
This bill would establish the Mandated Child Abuse Reporting Employee Training Act of 2016, which would require each governing board of a community college district to: (1) annually train, using the online training module developed by the State Department of Education, or other training, as specified, employees and administrators of the district who are mandated reporters on the mandated reporting requirements, as specified;
and
(2) develop a process for those persons required to receive training under the bill to provide proof of completing this training within the first 6 weeks of each academic year or within 6 weeks of that person’s
employment.
employment; and (3) develop a process to identify the students who are minors enrolled in classes at the community college district and provide that information only to faculty members and other employees who are mandated reporters, as specified.
The bill would provide that a person employed by more than one community college district or by more than one college in a single community college district is only required to receive the required training one time in each academic year. By imposing new duties on community college districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

Existing law provides for the procedure of approving and accepting bail, and issuing an order for the appearance and release of an arrested person. Existing law requires that bail be set in a fixed amount, as specified, and requires, in setting, reducing, or denying bail, a judge or magistrate to take into consideration the protection of the public, the seriousness of the offense charged, the previous criminal record of the defendant, and the probability of his or her appearing at trial or at a hearing of the case. Under existing law, the magistrate or commissioner to whom the application is made is authorized to set bail in an amount that he or she deems sufficient to ensure the defendant’s appearance or to ensure the protection of a victim, or family member of a victim, of domestic violence, and to set bail on the terms and conditions that he or she, in his or her discretion, deems appropriate, or he or she may authorize the defendant’s release on his or her own recognizance.
This bill would require, notwithstanding any other law, and upon the appearance before a competent court or magistrate of a person charged with a criminal offense, the court or magistrate to hold a specified hearing and take one of several actions, including, among others, releasing the person on his or her own recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond, unless the court or magistrate determines that release pursuant to that provision will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will endanger the safety of any other person or the community. The bill would also require the court or magistrate, if the court determines that releasing the person on his or her own recognizance or upon execution of an unsecured appearance bond will not reasonably assure his or her appearance as required or will endanger the safety of any other person or the community, to order the pretrial release of the person subject to specified conditions. If the court or magistrate finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community, the court or magistrate shall order the detention of the person before trial, except as otherwise specified. The bill would require the court or magistrate to order the detention of the person for a period of not more than 10 days, and direct the district attorney to notify the appropriate court, probation or parole officer, or federal, state or local law enforcement official, if the court or magistrate determines the person may flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community and the person is, and was at the time the offense was committed, released pending trial, released pending imposition or execution of sentence, appeal of sentence or conviction, or completion of sentence, or on conditional release, probation, postrelease community supervision, or parole.
The California Constitution requires that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable and that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented. Existing law declares that the use of potable domestic water for certain nonpotable uses is a waste or an unreasonable use of water if recycled water is available, as determined by the State Water Resources Control Board, and other requirements are met.
Under existing law, the state board and the 9 California regional water quality control boards prescribe waste discharge requirements in accordance with the federal national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit program established by the federal Clean Water Act and the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.
This bill would declare that, except in compliance with the bill’s provisions, it is a waste and unreasonable use of water to discharge treated wastewater from an ocean or bay outfall, or for a water supplier or water replenishment district to not take treated wastewater made available for certain purposes. The bill would require the state board to promulgate regulations, on or before January 1, 2020, that would require each NPDES permitholder, on or before January 1, 2023, to submit to the state board the permitholder’s plans to achieve beneficial reuse, to the maximum extent possible, of treated wastewater that would otherwise be discharged through ocean or bay outfalls. The bill would require these regulations to require, on or before January 1, 2033, the beneficial reuse of at least 50% of treated wastewater that the NPDES permitholder would otherwise discharge though ocean or bay outfalls relative to the inflow to the treatment plant. The bill would require the regulations to provide operational and compliance flexibility, as specified. The bill would authorize the state board to convene an advisory group and to consider any other recommendations or testimony provided during the regulation adoption process. The bill would authorize the state board to adopt reasonable fees payable by a holder of an NPDES permit to recover costs incurred in administering these provisions.

Discrimination includes, but is not limited to, restrictive covenants, zoning laws, denials of use permits, and other actions authorized under the Planning and Zoning Law (Title 7 (commencing with Section 65000)), that make housing opportunities unavailable.
Discrimination under this subdivision also includes the existence of a restrictive covenant, regardless of whether accompanied by a statement that the restrictive covenant is repealed or void.
(m) As used in this section, “race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, familial status, source of income, disability, or genetic information,” includes a perception that the person has any of those characteristics or that the person is associated with a person who has, or is perceived to have, any of those characteristics.
(n) To use a financial or income standard in the rental of housing that fails to account for the aggregate income of persons residing together or proposing to reside together on the same basis as the aggregate income of married persons residing together or proposing to reside together.
(o) In instances where there is a government rent subsidy, to use a financial or income standard in assessing eligibility for the rental of housing that is not based on the portion of the rent to be paid by the tenant.
(p) (1) For the purposes of this section, “source of income” means lawful, verifiable income paid directly to a tenant or paid to a representative of a tenant, or paid to a housing owner or landlord on behalf of a tenant, including federal, state, or local public assistance and federal, state, or local housing subsidies, including, but not limited to, federal housing assistance vouchers under Section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 1437f).
(2) For the purposes of this section, it shall not constitute discrimination based on source of income to make a written or oral inquiry concerning the level or source of income.
SEC. 3.
If the Commission on State Mandates determines that this act contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for those costs shall be made pursuant to Part 7 (commencing with Section 17500) of Division 4 of Title 2 of the Government Code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actual Output
Existing law generally prohibits housing discrimination with respect to various personal characteristics including source of income. Existing law defines “source of income” for these purposes as lawful, verifiable income paid directly to a tenant or paid to a representative of a tenant, which does not include a landlord.
This bill would amend the definition of “source of income” to also include specified federal, state, or local housing assistance or subsidies paid either to the tenant or directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant.
Existing law permits a person who holds an ownership interest of record in property that he or she believes is the subject of an unlawfully restrictive covenant based on, among other things, source of income, to record a Restrictive Covenant Modification, which is to include a copy of the original document with the illegal language stricken. Before recording the modification document, existing law requires the county recorder to submit the modification document and the original document to the county counsel who is required to determine whether the original document contains an unlawful restriction.
This bill, by revising the definition of source of income, would increase the requirements on a county counsel to determine if there exists an unlawfully restrictive covenant based on source of income, as described above. By creating new duties for county counsels, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

Existing law requires the State Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission to administer the State Energy Conservation Assistance Account, a continuously appropriated account in the General Fund, to provide grants and loans, until January 1, 2018, to schools, hospitals, public care institutions, and local governments to maximize energy use savings. For this purpose, existing law authorizes the commission, among other things, to borrow moneys from specified entities, including the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank, as specified, and pledge specified loans or the principal and interest payments on those loans to provide collateral in connection with those borrowed moneys. Existing law also authorizes the commission to enter into pledge agreements setting forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which the commission is making those pledges.
This bill would extend the operation of all of those provisions to January 1, 2028, and would thereby make an appropriation by extending the time during which the funds deposited in a continuously appropriated account are made available for expenditure. The bill would authorize the commission to pledge collateral to secure the repayment of bonds or other borrowings by the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. The bill would also expressly authorize the commission to enter into pledge agreements pursuant to which the commission is pledging collateral to secure the repayment of bonds or other borrowings by the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:
(a) Persons with developmental disabilities have to struggle to find gainful employment. Statewide unemployment among people with developmental disabilities of working age is approximately 90 percent.
(b) According to the Employment Development Department, the average annual earnings of employed persons with developmental disabilities is approximately five thousand five hundred dollars ($5,500).
(c) Within the community of people with developmental disabilities, people diagnosed with autism are the fastest growing population, making up approximately 50 percent of the annual new caseload of regional centers in some areas of the state.
(d) Seven years after exiting the K-12 school system, one in three adults with autism still does not have paid work experience or a college or technical education.
(e) Nationally recognized employment internship training models like Project SEARCH have demonstrated that many people with developmental disabilities can be successfully employed in jobs that earn a living wage.
(f) The key elements of successful programs like Project SEARCH are:
(1) The opportunity for people with developmental disabilities to be exposed to real work through internships.
(2) The opportunity for people with developmental disabilities to receive on-the-job customized training and support during internships.
(3) The opportunity for employers, in an internship setting, to experience firsthand the quality of work of a person with a developmental disability.
(g) The existing state hiring process for people with disabilities, known as the Limited Examination and Appointment Program, or LEAP, is not well suited to correctly assess the qualifications and abilities of many people with developmental disabilities because it relies on written testing as an assessment tool and is not performance based. As a result, very few people with developmental disabilities are represented in the state workforce.
(h) The Governor and the Legislature must address the lack of access people with developmental disabilities have to employment opportunities with the State of California and take steps to become a “model employer” to demonstrate the potential of this untapped workforce.
(i) In enacting this measure, the Legislature intends to create more access to state employment for people with developmental disabilities by allowing successful internship performance in a state agency, in lieu of a written test, to serve as meeting the minimum qualifications for consideration for hire into an entry-level position with the State of California. The Legislature further intends to grant flexibility to state agencies to hire persons with developmental disabilities who meet specific needs of those agencies into entry-level positions without requiring those persons to be able to perform the full range of tasks typically required by the entry-level job classification.
(j) The Legislature intends that these model employer practices be targeted at people with developmental disabilities who are between 18 and 30 years of age and are deemed eligible by the Department of Rehabilitation to receive supported employment services. If this population is left without purposefully designed pathways to employment, these young adults will remain at a high risk of public dependency throughout the course of their lives.

(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b), if the definition of “disability” used in the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-336) would result in broader protection of the civil rights of persons with a mental or physical disability, as defined in subdivision (b), then that broader protection shall be deemed incorporated by reference into, and shall prevail over conflicting provisions of, the definition in subdivision (b). The definition of “disability” contained in subdivision (b) shall not be deemed to refer to or include conditions excluded from the federal definition of “disability” pursuant to Section 511 of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.

Existing law requires the Department of Human Resources to administer the Limited Examination and Appointment Program (LEAP) to provide an alternative to the traditional civil service examination and appointment process to facilitate the hiring of persons with disabilities in the state civil services. Existing law requires the department to conduct competitive examinations to determine eligibility for appointment under LEAP and to refer the names of eligible applicants who meet the minimum qualifications of a job classification to the appointing powers for examination appointments, as specified.
This bill would permit a person with a developmental disability to either complete a written examination or readiness evaluation or an internship, as specified, to qualify for service under LEAP. The bill would require that the use of an internship as a competitive examination in this context consist of a successful completion of an internship with a state agency of not less than 512 hours in duration and a specified certification by the agency. The bill would require the department to refer the names of eligible applicants who successfully complete the internship to the appointing powers for examination appointments. The bill would require the department to create that internship program in coordination with the State Department of Developmental Services and the Department of Rehabilitation, as specified. The bill would require a state agency that provides the internship or appoints a person with a developmental disability to a position under LEAP to allow that person to receive on-the-job support. The bill would authorize an agency to finance the internship or position with personnel funds or other available funds assigned to a vacant or unfilled position, as specified, but would provide that on-the-job support services are not the financial or programmatic responsibility of any state agency engaged in establishing the LEAP internship process. The bill would specify that LEAP is not a mandate on any state agency employer or job applicant except to the extent specifically directed by the State Personnel Board. The bill would repeal these provisions on January 1, 2021.

(1) Existing law provides that the Superintendent of Public Instruction may authorize the California School for the Deaf, which is composed of two schools, the California School for the Deaf, Northern California, and the California School for the Deaf, Southern California, to establish and maintain a testing center for deaf and hard-of-hearing minors. Existing law provides that the purpose of the center shall be to test hearing acuity and to give such other tests as may be necessary for advising parents and school authorities concerning an appropriate educational program for the child. Existing law authorizes a pupil to be referred, as appropriate, to the California School for the Deaf, among other places, for further assessment and recommendations.
This bill would require the State Department of Education’s Deaf and Hard of Hearing unit and the state’s 2 schools for the deaf to jointly select language developmental milestones from existing standardized norms for purposes of developing a resource for use by parents to monitor and track deaf and hard-of-hearing children’s expressive and receptive language acquisition and developmental stages toward English literacy. The bill would require the language developmental milestones to be selected from the language developmental milestones recommended by an ad hoc advisory committee, which the bill would establish, as provided. The bill would require the parent resource to, among other things, make clear that it is not a formal assessment of language and literacy development, and that a parent’s observations of their children may differ from formal assessment data presented at an individualized family service plan (IFSP) or individualized education program (IEP) meeting, but to also make clear that a parent may bring the parent resource to an IFSP or IEP meeting for purposes of sharing their observations about their child’s development.
The bill would require the department to also select existing tools or assessments for educators that can be used to assess the language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children, as specified. The bill would authorize the educator tools or assessments to be used, in addition to the assessment required by federal law, by the child’s IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, to track deaf and hard-of-hearing children’s progress, and to establish or modify IFSP or IEP plans.
The bill would, if a child does not demonstrate progress in expressive and receptive language skills, as measured by one of the selected educator tools or assessments, or by the existing instrument used to satisfy federal law, require the child’s IFSP or IEP team, as applicable, to explain in detail the reasons why the child is not meeting the language developmental milestones or progressing towards them, and to recommend specific strategies, services, and programs that would be provided to assist the child’s success toward English literacy. To the extent this provision would impose additional duties on local educational agency officials, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The bill also would require the department to disseminate the language developmental milestones to parents and guardians of deaf or hard-of-hearing children, and, pursuant to federal law, to disseminate the selected educator tools and assessments to local educational agencies for use in the development and modification of IFSP and IEP plans, and to provide materials and training on its use to assist the deaf or hard-of-hearing child in becoming linguistically ready for kindergarten using both or one of the languages of American Sign Language and English.
The bill would require the department, commencing on or before July 31, 2017, and on or before each July 31 thereafter, to produce a report that is specific to language and literacy development of deaf and hard-of-hearing children from birth to 5 years of age, inclusive, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing and have other disabilities, relative to their peers who are not deaf or hard of hearing, as specified. The bill would require the department to make the report available on its Internet Web site.
The bill would make these provisions applicable only to children from birth to 5 years of age, inclusive. The bill also would provide that implementation of these provisions is subject to an appropriation being made for these purposes in the annual Budget Act or another statute.
(2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

Existing law establishes the California Community Colleges, under the administration of the Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges, as one of the segments of public postsecondary education in this state. Existing law establishes community college districts, administered by governing boards, throughout the state, and authorizes these districts to provide instruction to students at the community college campuses maintained by the districts. Existing law authorizes the employment of community college faculty and establishes certain rights for these employees.
This bill would require community college districts to report to the board of governors, by March 31, 2016, the total number of full-time equivalent faculty (FTEF)

The bill would authorize a district to submit an application for an exemption from the requirements of the bill in cases of serious hardship, as specified. Upon receipt of the exemption application, the bill would require the governing board to grant exemptions, as specified. The bill would require the amount exempted to be immediately available for expenditure by the governing board and the amount not exempted to be returned to the State School Fund. The bill would require the board of governors to enforce the requirements of the bill and would authorize them to adopt necessary rules and regulations.
This bill would prohibit a district from assigning a person hired as a contract faculty member after July 1, 2016, to teach any overload assignment in excess of the equivalent of a full-time teaching load until the person achieves tenured status as a
full-time
regular
faculty member.
By placing additional requirements on community college districts, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

(2) The provision of personal care services at the recipient’s place of employment shall be authorized only to the extent that the total hours utilized at the workplace are within the total personal care services hours authorized for the recipient in the home. Additional personal care services hours may not be authorized in connection with a recipient’s employment.
(e)
Where
If
supportive services are provided by a person having the legal duty pursuant to the Family Code to provide for the care of his or her child who is the recipient, the provider of supportive services shall receive remuneration for the services only when the provider leaves full-time employment or is prevented from obtaining full-time employment because no other suitable provider is available and where the inability of the provider to provide supportive services may result in inappropriate placement or inadequate care.
These providers shall be paid only for the following:
(1) Services related to domestic services.
(2) Personal care services.
(3) Accompaniment by a provider when needed during necessary travel to health-related appointments or to alternative resource sites.
(4) Protective supervision only as needed because of the functional limitations of the child.
(5) Paramedical services.
(f) To encourage maximum voluntary services, so as to reduce governmental costs, respite care shall also be provided. Respite care is temporary or periodic service for eligible recipients to relieve persons who are providing care without compensation.
(g) A person who is eligible to receive
a service or
services under an approved federal waiver authorized pursuant to Section 14132.951, or a person who is eligible to receive
a service or
services authorized pursuant to Section 14132.95, shall not be eligible to receive the same
service or
services pursuant to this article. In the event that the waiver authorized pursuant to Section 14132.951, as approved by the federal government, does not extend eligibility to all persons otherwise eligible for services under this article, or does not cover a service or particular services, or does not cover the scope of a service that a person would otherwise be eligible to receive under this article, those persons who are not eligible for services, or for a particular service under the waiver or Section 14132.95 shall be eligible for services under this article.
(h) (1) All services provided pursuant to this article shall be equal in amount, scope, and duration to the same services provided pursuant to Section 14132.95, including any adjustments that may be made to those services pursuant to subdivision (e) of Section 14132.95.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the rate of reimbursement for in-home supportive services provided through any mode of service shall not exceed the rate of reimbursement established under subdivision (j) of Section 14132.95 for the same mode of service unless otherwise provided in the annual Budget Act.
(3) The maximum number of hours available under Section 14132.95, Section 14132.951, and this section, combined, shall be 283 hours per month. Any recipient of services under this article shall receive no more than the applicable maximum specified in Section 12303.4.

Existing law provides for the county-administered In-Home Supportive Services program, under which qualified aged, blind, and disabled persons are provided with services in order to permit them to remain in their own homes and avoid institutionalization.
This bill would make technical, nonsubstantive changes to these provisions.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Chapter 2.55 (commencing with Section 1000.7) is added to Title 6 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, to read:
CHAPTER  2.55. Deferred Entry of Judgment Pilot Program
1000.7.
(a) The following counties may establish a pilot program pursuant to this section to operate a deferred entry of judgment pilot program for eligible defendants described in subdivision (b):
(1) County of Alameda.
(2) County of Butte.
(3) County of Napa.
(4) County of Nevada.
(5) County of Santa Clara.
(b) A defendant may participate in a deferred entry of judgment pilot program within the county’s juvenile hall if that person is charged with committing a felony offense, other than the offenses listed under subdivision (d), he or she pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and the probation department determines that the person meets all of the following requirements:
(1) Is 18 years of age or older, but under 21 years of age on the date the offense was committed.
(2) Is suitable for the program after evaluation using a risk assessment tool, as described in subdivision (c).
(3) Shows the ability to benefit from services generally reserved for delinquents, including, but not limited to, cognitive behavioral therapy, other mental health services, and age-appropriate educational, vocational, and supervision services, that are currently deployed under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
(4) Meets the rules of the juvenile hall developed in accordance with the applicable regulations set forth in Title 15 of the California Code of Regulations.
(5) Does not have a prior or current conviction for committing an offense listed under subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7 or subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, or subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(6) Is not required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Chapter 5.5 (commencing with Section 290) of Title 9 of Part 1.
(c) The probation department, in consultation with the superior court, district attorney, and sheriff of the county or the governmental body charged with operating the county jail, shall develop an evaluation process using a risk assessment tool to determine eligibility for the program.
(d) If the defendant is required to register as a sex offender pursuant to Chapter 5.5 (commencing with Section 290) of Title 9 of Part 1, or if he or she has been convicted of one or more of the following offenses, he or she is not eligible for the program:
(1) An offense listed under subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7.
(2) An offense listed under subdivision (c) of Section 667.5.
(3) An offense listed under subdivision (b) of Section 707 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.
(e) The court shall grant deferred entry of judgment if an eligible defendant consents to participate in the program, waives his or her right to a speedy trial or a speedy preliminary hearing, pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and waives time for the pronouncement of judgment.
(f) (1) If the probation department determines that the defendant is not eligible for the deferred entry of judgment pilot program or the defendant does not consent to participate in the program, the proceedings shall continue as in any other case.
(2) If it appears to the probation department that the defendant is performing unsatisfactorily in the program as a result of the commission of a new crime or the violation of any of the rules of the juvenile hall or that the defendant is not benefiting from the services in the program, the probation department may make a motion for entry of judgment. After notice to the defendant, the court shall hold a hearing to determine whether judgment should be entered. If the court finds that the defendant is performing unsatisfactorily in the program or that the defendant is not benefiting from the services in the program, the court shall render a finding of guilt to the charge or charges pleaded, enter judgment, and schedule a sentencing hearing as otherwise provided in this code, and the probation department, in consultation with the county sheriff, shall remove the defendant from the program and return him or her to custody in county jail. The mechanism of when and how the defendant is moved from custody in juvenile hall to custody in a county jail shall be determined by the local multidisciplinary team specified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (m).
(3) If the defendant has performed satisfactorily during the period in which deferred entry of judgment was granted, at the end of that period, the court shall dismiss the criminal charge or charges.
(g) A defendant shall serve no longer than one year in custody within a county’s juvenile hall pursuant to the program.
(h) The probation department shall develop a plan for reentry services, including, but not limited to, housing, employment, and education services, as a component of the program.
(i) The probation department shall submit data relating to the effectiveness of the program to the Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry, within the Department of Justice, including recidivism rates for program participants as compared to recidivism rates for similar populations in the adult system within the county.
(j) A defendant participating in the program pursuant to this section shall not come into contact with minors within the juvenile hall for any purpose, including, but not limited to, housing, recreation, or education.
(k) Prior to establishing a pilot program pursuant to this section, the county shall apply to the Board of State and Community Corrections for approval of a county institution as a suitable place for confinement for the purpose of the pilot program. The board shall review and approve or deny the application of the county within 30 days of receiving notice of this proposed use. In its review, the board shall take into account the available programming, capacity, and safety of the institution as a place for the confinement and rehabilitation of individuals within the jurisdiction of the criminal court, and those within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court.
(l) The Board of State and Community Corrections shall review a county’s pilot program to ensure compliance with requirements of the federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 5601 et seq.), as amended, relating to “sight and sound” separation between juveniles and adult inmates.
(m) (1) This section applies to a defendant who would otherwise serve time in custody in a county jail. Participation in a program pursuant to this section shall not be authorized as an alternative to a sentence involving community supervision.
(2) Each county shall establish a multidisciplinary team that shall meet periodically to review and discuss the implementation, practices, and impact of the program. The team shall include representatives from the following:
(A) Probation department.
(B) The district attorney’s office.
(C) The public defender’s office.
(D) The sheriff’s department.
(E) Courts located in the county.
(F) The county board of supervisors.
(G) The county health and human services department.
(H) A youth advocacy group.
(n) (1) A county that establishes a pilot program pursuant to this section shall submit data regarding the pilot program to the Board of State and Community Corrections. The data submitted shall be used for the purposes of paragraph (2).
(2) The board shall conduct an evaluation of the pilot program’s impact and effectiveness. The evaluation shall include, but not be limited to, evaluating each pilot program’s impact on sentencing and impact on opportunities for community supervision, monitoring the program’s effect on minors in the juvenile facility, if any, and its effectiveness with respect to program participants, including outcome-related data for program participants compared to young adult offenders sentenced for comparable crimes.
(3) Each evaluation shall be combined into a comprehensive report and submitted to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Public Safety.
(4) The board may contract with an independent entity, including, but not limited to, the Regents of the University of California, for the purposes of carrying out the duties of the board pursuant to this subdivision.
(o) This chapter shall remain in effect only until January 1, 2020, and as of that date is repealed, unless a later enacted statute, that is enacted before January 1, 2020, deletes or extends that date.
SEC. 2.
The Legislature finds and declares that a special law is necessary and that a general law cannot be made applicable within the meaning of Section 16 of Article IV of the California Constitution because of the unique circumstances in the Counties of Alameda, Butte, Napa, Nevada, and Santa Clara. Recent research on the adolescent brain development has found that brain development continues well after an individual reaches 18 years of age. This bill would therefore allow for the criminal justice system to apply the most recent brain development research to its practices in these counties by allowing certain transitional age youth access to age-appropriate rehabilitative services available in the juvenile justice system when an assessment determines that the individual would benefit from the services, with the aim of reducing the likelihood of the youth continuing in the criminal justice system.

Existing law provides that entry of judgment may be deferred with respect to a defendant who is charged with certain crimes involving possession of controlled substances, who pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and who meets certain criteria, including that he or she has no prior convictions for any offense involving controlled substances and has had no felony convictions within the 5 years prior, as specified. Existing law requires the criminal charge or charges to be dismissed if the defendant has performed satisfactorily in a specified program during the period in which deferred entry of judgment was granted.
This bill would authorize specified counties to establish a pilot program to operate a deferred entry of judgment pilot program for eligible defendants. The bill would authorize a defendant to participate in the program within the county’s juvenile hall if that person is charged with committing a felony offense, except as specified, he or she pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and the probation department determines that the person meets specified requirements, including that the defendant is 18 years of age or older, but under 21 years of age on the date the offense was committed, is suitable for the program, and shows the ability to benefit from services generally reserved for delinquents. The bill would require the probation department to develop a plan for reentry services.
The bill would require the court to grant deferred entry of judgment if the eligible defendant consents to participate in the program, waives his or her right to a speedy trial or a speedy preliminary hearing, pleads guilty to the charge or charges, and waives time for the pronouncement of judgment. The bill would also require the court to render a finding of guilt to the charge or charges pleaded, enter judgment, and schedule a sentencing hearing, and would require the return of the defendant to custody in a county jail if the court finds that the defendant is performing unsatisfactorily in the program or that the defendant is not benefiting from the services in the program. If the defendant has performed satisfactorily during the period in which deferred entry of judgment was granted, at the end of that period, the bill would require the court to dismiss the criminal charge or charges.
The bill would require a county, prior to establishing a pilot program, to apply to the Board of State and Community Corrections for approval of a county institution as a suitable place for confinement for the purpose of the pilot program. The bill would require the board to review and approve or deny the application of the county within 30 days of receiving notice of this proposed use. The bill would also require each county to establish a multidisciplinary team consisting of representatives of specified local entities. The team would be required to meet periodically to review and discuss the implementation, practices, and impact of the program.
The bill would require the probation department to submit data relating to the effectiveness of the program to the Division of Recidivism Reduction and Re-Entry, within the Department of Justice. The bill would prohibit a defendant participating in the program from coming into contact with minors within the juvenile hall, would prohibit a defendant from serving longer than one year in custody within a county’s juvenile hall pursuant to the program, and would require the board to review a county’s pilot program to ensure compliance with the federal Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as specified.
The bill would require a county that establishes a pilot program pursuant to these provisions to submit data regarding the pilot program to the board, and would require the board to conduct an evaluation of the pilot program’s impact and effectiveness, as specified. The bill would require the evaluation to be combined into a comprehensive report and submitted to the Assembly and Senate Committees on Public Safety. The bill would also authorize the board to contract with an independent entity, including, but not limited to, the Regents of the University of California, to carry out these duties.
The authority conferred by this bill would be repealed on January 1, 2020.
This bill would make legislative findings and declarations as to the necessity of a special statute for the Counties of Alameda, Butte, Napa, Nevada, and Santa Clara.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 2851 of the Public Utilities Code is amended to read:
2851.
(a) In implementing the California Solar Initiative, the commission shall do all of the following:
(1) (A) The commission shall authorize the award of monetary incentives for up to the first megawatt of alternating current generated by solar energy systems that meet the eligibility criteria established by the Energy Commission pursuant to Chapter 8.8 (commencing with Section 25780) of Division 15 of the Public Resources Code. The commission shall determine the eligibility of a solar energy system, as defined in Section 25781 of the Public Resources Code, to receive monetary incentives until the time the Energy Commission establishes eligibility criteria pursuant to Section 25782. Monetary incentives shall not be awarded for solar energy systems that do not meet the eligibility criteria. The incentive level authorized by the commission shall decline each year following implementation of the California Solar Initiative, at a rate of no less than an average of 7 percent per year, and, except as provided in subparagraph (B), shall be zero as of December 31, 2016. The commission shall adopt and publish a schedule of declining incentive levels no less than 30 days in advance of the first decline in incentive levels. The commission may develop incentives based upon the
output of electricity from
electricity generated by
the system, provided those incentives are consistent with the declining incentive levels of this paragraph and the incentives apply to only the first megawatt of electricity generated by the system.
(B) The incentive level for the installation of a solar energy system pursuant to Section 2852 shall be zero as of December 31, 2021.
(2) The commission shall adopt a performance-based incentive program so that by January 1, 2008, 100 percent of incentives for solar energy systems of 100 kilowatts or greater and at least 50 percent of incentives for solar energy systems of 30 kilowatts or greater are earned based on the actual electrical output of the solar energy systems. The commission shall encourage, and may require, performance-based incentives for solar energy systems of less than 30 kilowatts. Performance-based incentives shall decline at a rate of no less than an average of 7 percent per year. In developing the performance-based incentives, the commission may:
(A) Apply performance-based incentives only to customer classes designated by the commission.
(B) Design the performance-based incentives so that customers may receive a higher level of incentives than under incentives based on installed electrical capacity.
(C) Develop financing options that help offset the installation costs of the solar energy system, provided that this financing is ultimately repaid in full by the consumer or through the application of the performance-based rebates.
(3) By January 1, 2008, the commission, in consultation with the Energy Commission, shall require reasonable and cost-effective energy efficiency improvements in existing buildings as a condition of providing incentives for eligible solar energy systems, with appropriate exemptions or limitations to accommodate the limited financial resources of low-income residential housing.
(4) Notwithstanding subdivision (g) of Section 2827, the commission may develop a time-variant tariff that creates the maximum incentive for ratepayers to install solar energy systems so that the system’s peak electricity production coincides with California’s peak electricity demands and that ensures that ratepayers receive due value for their contribution to the purchase of solar energy systems and customers with solar energy systems continue to have an incentive to use electricity efficiently. In developing the time-variant tariff, the commission may exclude customers participating in the tariff from the rate cap for residential customers for existing baseline quantities or usage by those customers of up to 130 percent of existing baseline quantities, as required by Section 739.9. Nothing in this paragraph authorizes the commission to require time-variant pricing for ratepayers without a solar energy system.
(b) Notwithstanding subdivision (a), in implementing the California Solar Initiative, the commission may authorize the award of monetary incentives for solar thermal and solar water heating devices, in a total amount up to one hundred million eight hundred thousand dollars ($100,800,000).
(c) (1) In implementing the California Solar Initiative, the commission shall not allocate more than fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) to research, development, and demonstration that explores solar technologies and other distributed generation technologies that employ or could employ solar energy for generation or storage of electricity or to offset natural gas usage. Any program that allocates additional moneys to research, development, and demonstration shall be developed in collaboration with the Energy Commission to ensure there is no duplication of efforts, and adopted by the commission through a rulemaking or other appropriate public proceeding. Any grant awarded by the commission for research, development, and demonstration shall be approved by the full commission at a public meeting. This subdivision does not prohibit the commission from continuing to allocate moneys to research, development, and demonstration pursuant to the self-generation incentive program for distributed generation resources originally established pursuant to Chapter 329 of the Statutes of 2000, as modified pursuant to Section 379.6.
(2) The Legislature finds and declares that a program that provides a stable source of monetary incentives for eligible solar energy systems will encourage private investment sufficient to make solar technologies cost effective.
(3) On or before June 30, 2009, and by June 30th of every year thereafter, the commission shall submit to the Legislature an assessment of the success of the California Solar Initiative program. That assessment shall include the number of residential and commercial sites that have installed solar thermal devices for which an award was made pursuant to subdivision (b) and the dollar value of the award, the number of residential and commercial sites that have installed solar energy systems, the electrical generating capacity of the installed solar energy systems, the cost of the program, total electrical system benefits, including the effect on electrical service rates, environmental benefits, how the program affects the operation and reliability of the electrical grid, how the program has affected peak demand for electricity, the progress made toward reaching the goals of the program, whether the program is on schedule to meet the program goals, and recommendations for improving the program to meet its goals. If the commission allocates additional moneys to research, development, and demonstration that explores solar technologies and other distributed generation technologies pursuant to paragraph (1), the commission shall include in the assessment submitted to the Legislature, a description of the program, a summary of each award made or project funded pursuant to the program, including the intended purposes to be achieved by the particular award or project, and the results of each award or project.
(d) (1) The commission shall not impose any charge upon the consumption of natural gas, or upon natural gas ratepayers, to fund the California Solar Initiative.
(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any charge imposed to fund the program adopted and implemented pursuant to this section shall be imposed upon all customers not participating in the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) or family electric rate assistance (FERA) programs, including those residential customers subject to the rate limitation specified in Section 739.9 for existing baseline quantities or usage up to 130 percent of existing baseline quantities of electricity.
(3) The costs of the program adopted and implemented pursuant to this section shall not be recovered from customers participating in the California Alternate Rates for Energy or CARE program established pursuant to Section 739.1, except to the extent that program costs are recovered out of the nonbypassable system benefits charge authorized pursuant to Section 399.8.
(e) Except as provided in subdivision (f), in implementing the California Solar Initiative, the commission shall ensure that the total cost over the duration of the program does not exceed three billion five hundred fifty million eight hundred thousand dollars ($3,550,800,000). Except as provided in subdivision (f), financial components of the California Solar Initiative shall consist of the following:
(1) Programs under the supervision of the commission funded by charges collected from customers of San Diego Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison Company, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Except as provided in subdivision (f), the total cost over the duration of these programs shall not exceed two billion three hundred sixty-six million eight hundred thousand dollars ($2,366,800,000) and includes moneys collected directly into a tracking account for support of the California Solar Initiative.
(2) Programs adopted, implemented, and financed in the amount of seven hundred eighty-four million dollars ($784,000,000), by charges collected by local publicly owned electric utilities pursuant to Section 2854. Nothing in this subdivision shall give the commission power and jurisdiction with respect to a local publicly owned electric utility or its customers.
(3) Programs for the installation of solar energy systems on new construction (New Solar Homes Partnership Program), administered by the Energy Commission, and funded by charges in the amount of four hundred million dollars ($400,000,000), collected from customers of San Diego Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison Company, and Pacific Gas and Electric Company. If the commission is notified by the Energy Commission that funding available pursuant to Section 25751 of the Public Resources Code for the New Solar Homes Partnership Program and any other funding for the purposes of this paragraph have been exhausted, the commission may require an electrical corporation to continue administration of the program pursuant to the guidelines established for the program by the Energy Commission, until the funding limit authorized by this paragraph has been reached. The commission, in consultation with the Energy Commission, shall supervise the administration of the continuation of the New Solar Homes Partnership Program by an electrical corporation. An electrical corporation may elect to have a third party, including the Energy Commission, administer the utility’s continuation of the New Solar Homes Partnership Program. After the exhaustion of funds, the Energy Commission shall notify the Joint Legislative Budget Committee 30 days prior to the continuation of the program.
(4) The changes made to this subdivision by Chapter 39 of the Statutes of 2012 do not authorize the levy of a charge or any increase in the amount collected pursuant to any existing charge, nor do the changes add to, or detract from, the commission’s existing authority to levy or increase charges.
(f) Upon the expenditure or reservation in any electrical corporation’s service territory of the amount specified in paragraph (1) of subdivision (e) for low-income residential housing programs pursuant to subdivision (c) of Section 2852, the commission shall authorize the continued collection of the charge for the purposes of Section 2852. The commission shall ensure that the total amount collected pursuant to this subdivision does not exceed one hundred eight million dollars ($108,000,000). Upon approval by the commission, an electrical corporation may use amounts collected pursuant to subdivision (e) for purposes of funding the general market portion of the California Solar Initiative, that remain unspent and unencumbered after December 31, 2016, to reduce the electrical corporation’s portion of the total amount collected pursuant to this subdivision.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
(a) The Legislature finds and declares as follows:
(1) The waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever-increasing demand.
(2) Landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development, among other benefits.
(3) Landscape design, installation, maintenance, and management can and should be water efficient.
(4) Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and that the right does not extend to the waste or unreasonable use of water.
(5) Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed, and maintained with a watershed-based approach can improve California’s environmental conditions, provide benefits, and realize sustainability goals such as the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and recycling goals, and conserve energy. These landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes.
(6) Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention, and promoting productive plant growth leads to more carbon storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat, and aesthetic benefits.
(7) Energy use can be minimized by using efficient irrigation systems, reducing reliance on petroleum-based fertilizers and pesticides, and planting climate-appropriate edible plants and shade trees in urban areas.
(8) Water can be conserved by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate-appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment.
(9) Air and water quality can be protected by using low- or zero-emissions outdoor equipment, reducing landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and local sources of material, using compost mulch and efficient irrigation equipment, and designing landscapes to prevent erosion.
(10) Existing habitat can be protected and new habitat created by choosing local native plants and climate-adapted plants, avoiding invasive plants, and using environmentally sound integrated pest management with the least toxic methods as a first course of action.
(11) Stormwater management practices can minimize runoff and increase infiltration that recharges groundwater and improves water quality. Implementing stormwater best management practices into the landscape and grading design plans to minimize runoff and increase onsite rainwater retention and infiltration should be encouraged.
(b) It is the intent of the Legislature that the California Water Efficient Landscaping Program furthers and accomplishes water conservation, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions reduction and climate adaptation.

Actual Output
The California Constitution requires that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable and that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented. Existing law, the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, requires the Department of Water Resources to update its model water-efficient landscape ordinance by regulation and prescribes various requirements for the updated model ordinance. Existing law requires each local agency to adopt either the updated model water-efficient landscape ordinance or an ordinance that is at least as effective in conserving water as the updated model ordinance. If the local agency does not make a selection, the model ordinance shall apply within the jurisdiction of the local agency.
This bill would require the department
, upon identification of a funding source,
to create the California Water Efficient Landscaping Program for the purpose of encouraging local agencies and water purveyors to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water, promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances, and support and enhance water inefficient grass replacement. This bill would create the Water Efficient Landscaping Fund and provide that moneys in the fund are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the department for certain purposes.

The bill would require a qualified supervisor of health or administrator at a school district, county office of education, or charter school electing to utilize naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist for emergency medical aid to obtain the prescription for naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist from an authorizing physician and surgeon, as defined, and would authorize the prescription to be filled by local or mail order pharmacies or naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist manufacturers.
The bill would authorize school nurses or, if the school does not have a school nurse, a person who has received training regarding naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist to immediately administer naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist under certain circumstances. The bill would provide that volunteers may administer naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist only by nasal spray or by auto-injector, as specified.
The bill would prohibit an authorizing physician and surgeon from being subject to professional review, being liable in a civil action, or being subject to criminal prosecution for any act in the issuing of a prescription or order, pursuant to these provisions, unless the act constitutes gross negligence or willful or malicious conduct. The bill would prohibit a person trained under these provisions who administers naloxone hydrochloride or another opioid antagonist, in good faith and not for compensation, to a person who appears to be experiencing an opioid overdose from being subject to professional review, being liable in a civil action, or being subject to criminal prosecution for this administration.

(g) Except when the court requires the convicted person to remove waste matter which he or she is responsible for dumping as a condition of probation, the court may, in addition to the fine imposed upon a conviction, require as a condition of probation, in addition to any other condition of probation, that a person convicted of a violation of this section pick up waste matter at a time and place within the jurisdiction of the court for not less than 12 hours.
(h) (1) A person who places, deposits, or dumps, or causes to be placed, deposited, or dumped, waste matter in violation of this section in commercial quantities shall be guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than six months and by a fine.

(2) “Commercial quantities” means an amount of waste matter generated in the course of a trade, business, profession, or occupation, or an amount equal to or in excess of one cubic yard. This subdivision does not apply to the dumping of household waste at a person’s residence.
(i) (1) A person who places, deposits, or dumps, or causes to be placed, deposited, or dumped, waste matter upon private property, including on any private highway or road, without the consent of the owner shall be punished by a fine.

(2)  If the court finds that the waste matter placed, deposited, or dumped includes used tires, the fine prescribed in this subdivision shall be doubled. A separate fine in the same amount as initially imposed shall accrue for each day that waste placed, deposited, or dumped remains unabated, but no additional conviction for the purposes of punishments in paragraph (1) shall arise for the same act. For the fourth or subsequent violation, each day that waste placed, deposited, or dumped remains shall not result in the accrual of a separate fine or violation for the purposes of punishments in paragraph (1).
(j) For purposes of this section, “person” means an individual, trust, firm, partnership, joint stock company, joint venture, or corporation.
(k) Except in unusual cases where the interests of justice would be best served by waiving or reducing a fine, the minimum fines provided by this section shall not be waived or reduced.
SEC. 2.
No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution.

The bill would make a 4th or subsequent conviction a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than 30 days and by a fine of not less than $750 nor more than $3,000.
By changing the definition of a crime, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 10010 of the Elections Code is amended to read:
10010.
(a) A political subdivision that changes from an at-large method of election to a district-based election, or that establishes district-based elections, shall do all of the following before a public hearing at which the governing body of the political subdivision votes to approve or defeat an ordinance establishing district-based elections:
(1) Before drawing a draft map or maps of the proposed boundaries of the districts, the political subdivision shall hold at least two public hearings over a period of no more than thirty days, at which the public is invited to provide input regarding the composition of the districts. Before these hearings, the political subdivision may conduct outreach to the public, including to non-English-speaking communities, to explain the districting process and to encourage public participation.
(2) After all draft maps are drawn, the political subdivision shall publish and make available for release at least one draft map and, if members of the governing body of the political subdivision will be elected in their districts at different times to provide for staggered terms of office, the potential sequence of the elections. The political subdivision shall also hold at least two additional hearings over a period of no more than 45 days, at which the public is invited to provide input regarding the content of the draft map or maps and the proposed sequence of elections, if applicable. The first version of a draft map shall be published at least seven days before consideration at a hearing. If a draft map is revised at or following a hearing, it shall be published and made available to the public for at least seven days before being adopted.
(b) In determining the final sequence of the district elections conducted in a political subdivision in which members of the governing body will be elected at different times to provide for staggered terms of office, the governing body shall give special consideration to the purposes of the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (Chapter 1.5 (commencing with Section 14025) of Division 14 of this code), and it shall take into account the preferences expressed by members of the districts.
(c) This section applies to, but is not limited to, a proposal that is required due to a court-imposed change from an at-large method of election to a district-based election.
(d) For purposes of this section, the following terms have the following meanings:
(1) “At-large method of election” has the same meaning as set forth in subdivision (a) of Section 14026.
(2) “District-based election” has the same meaning as set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 14026.
(3) “Political subdivision” has the same meaning as set forth in subdivision (c) of Section 14026.
(e) (1) Before commencing an action to enforce Sections 14027 and 14028, a prospective plaintiff shall send by certified mail a written notice to the clerk of the political subdivision against which the action would be brought asserting that the political subdivision’s method of conducting elections may violate the California Voting Rights Act.
(2) A prospective plaintiff shall not commence an action to enforce Sections 14027 and 14028 within 45 days of the political subdivision’s receipt of the written notice described in paragraph (1).
(3) (A) Before receiving a written notice described in paragraph (1), or within 45 days of receipt of a notice, a political subdivision may pass a resolution outlining its intention to transition from at-large to district-based elections, specific steps it will undertake to facilitate this transition, and an estimated time frame for doing so.
(B) If a political subdivision passes a resolution pursuant to subparagraph (A), a prospective plaintiff shall not commence an action to enforce Sections 14027 and 14028 within 90 days of the resolution’s passage.
(f) (1) If a political subdivision adopts an ordinance establishing district-based elections pursuant to subdivision (a), a prospective plaintiff who sent a written notice pursuant to subdivision (e) before the political subdivision passed its resolution of intention may, within 30 days of the ordinance’s adoption, demand reimbursement for the cost of the work product generated to support the notice. A prospective plaintiff shall make the demand in writing and shall substantiate the demand with financial documentation, such as a detailed invoice for demography services. A political subdivision may request additional documentation if the provided documentation is insufficient to corroborate the claimed costs. A political subdivision shall reimburse a prospective plaintiff for reasonable costs claimed, or in an amount to which the parties mutually agree, within 45 days of receiving the written demand, except as provided in paragraph (2). In all cases, the amount of the reimbursement shall not exceed the cap described in paragraph (3).
(2) If more than one prospective plaintiff is entitled to reimbursement, the political subdivision shall reimburse the prospective plaintiffs in the order in which they sent a written notice pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (e), and the 45-day time period described in paragraph (1) shall apply only to reimbursement of the first prospective plaintiff who sent a written notice. The cumulative amount of reimbursements to all prospective plaintiffs shall not exceed the cap described in paragraph (3).
(3) The amount of reimbursement required by this section is capped at $30,000, as adjusted annually to the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, U.S. city average, as published by the United States Department of Labor.
SEC. 2.

Existing law provides for political subdivisions that encompass areas of representation within the state. With respect to these areas, public officials are generally elected by all of the voters of the political subdivision (at-large) or by districts formed within the political subdivision (district-based). Existing law requires a political subdivision, as defined, that changes from an at-large method of election to a district-based election to hold at least 2 public hearings on a proposal to establish the district boundaries of the political subdivision before a public hearing at which the governing body of the political subdivision votes to approve or defeat the proposal.
This bill would instead require a political subdivision that changes to, or establishes, district-based elections to hold public hearings before and after drawing a preliminary map or maps of the proposed district boundaries, as specified.
Existing law, the California Voting Rights Act of 2001 (CVRA), prohibits the use of an at-large method of election in a political subdivision if it would impair the ability of a protected class, as defined, to elect candidates of its choice or otherwise influence the outcome of an election. The CVRA provides that a voter who is a member of a protected class may bring an action in superior court to enforce its provisions.
This bill would require a prospective plaintiff under the CVRA to first send a written notice to the political subdivision against which the action would be brought indicating that the method of election used by the political subdivision may violate the CVRA. The bill would permit the political subdivision to take ameliorative steps to correct the alleged violation before the prospective plaintiff commences litigation, and it would stay the prospective plaintiff’s ability to file suit for a prescribed amount of time. This bill would also permit a prospective plaintiff who sent a written notice, as described, to recover from the political subdivision reasonable costs incurred in supporting the written notice.
Because the bill would impose additional duties on local agencies, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program.
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.
This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.

Under existing law, the Lanterman Developmental Disabilities Services Act, the State Department of Developmental Services is authorized to contract with regional centers to provide services and supports to individuals with developmental disabilities. Existing law requires an entity that receives payments between $250,000 and $500,000 per year from one or more regional centers to obtain an independent audit or review of its financial statements and requires an entity that receives payments that are equal to or more than $500,000 per year to obtain an independent audit. Existing law exempts payments made using usual and customary rates for services provided by regional centers from these requirements.
This bill would instead require an entity to obtain an independent audit or review report of its financial statements relating to payments made by regional centers if it receives payments between $500,000 and $2,000,000 from one or more regional centers and would authorize these entities to apply for, and require the regional center to grant, a 2-year exemption from this requirement if the regional center does not find issues in the audit or review that have an impact on regional center services. The bill would also require an entity to obtain an independent audit if it receives payments that are equal to or more than $2,000,000 and would authorize these entities to apply for, and require the regional center to grant, a 2-year exemption from the audit requirement if the audit resulted in an unmodified opinion, an unmodified opinion with additional communication, or a qualified opinion with issues that are not material and pervasive. The bill would require a regional center to notify the department of any exemption it grants to an entity that receives a qualified opinion report. The bill would also exempt social security benefit payments from these requirements.

The people of the State of California do enact as follows:


SECTION 1.
Section 7612 of the Family Code is amended to read:
7612.
(a) Except as provided in Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 7540) and Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 7570) of Part 2 or in Section 20102, a presumption under Section 7611 is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of proof and may be rebutted in an appropriate action only by clear and convincing evidence.
(b) If two or more presumptions arise under Section 7610 or 7611 that conflict with each other, or if a presumption under Section 7611 conflicts with a claim pursuant to Section 7610, the presumption which on the facts is founded on the weightier considerations of policy and logic controls.
(c) In an appropriate action, a court may find that more than two persons with a claim to parentage under this division are parents if the court finds that recognizing only two parents would be detrimental to the child. In determining detriment to the child, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the harm of removing the child from a stable placement with a parent who has fulfilled the child’s physical needs and the child’s psychological needs for care and affection, and who has assumed that role for a substantial period of time. A finding of detriment to the child does not require a finding of unfitness of any of the parents or persons with a claim to parentage.
(d) Unless a court orders otherwise after making the determination specified in subdivision (c), a presumption under Section 7611 is rebutted by a judgment establishing parentage of the child by another person.
(e) Within two years of the execution of a voluntary declaration of paternity, a person who is presumed to be a parent under Section 7611 may file a petition pursuant to Section 7630 to set aside a voluntary declaration of paternity. The court’s ruling on the petition to set aside the voluntary declaration of paternity shall be made taking into account the validity of the voluntary declaration of paternity, and the best interests of the child based upon the court’s consideration of the factors set forth in subdivision (b) of Section 7575, as well as the best interests of the child based upon the nature, duration, and quality of the petitioning party’s relationship with the child and the benefit or detriment to the child of continuing that relationship. In the event of any conflict between the presumption under Section 7611 and the voluntary declaration of paternity, the weightier considerations of policy and logic shall control.
(f) A voluntary declaration of paternity is invalid if, at the time the declaration was signed, any of the following conditions exist:
(1) The child already had a presumed parent under Section 7540.
(2) The child already had a presumed parent under subdivision (a), (b), or (c) of Section 7611.
(3) The man signing the declaration is a sperm donor, consistent with subdivision (b) of Section 7613.
(g) A person’s offer or refusal to sign a voluntary declaration of paternity may be considered as a factor, but shall not be determinative, as to the issue of legal parentage in any proceedings regarding the establishment or termination of parental rights.

Under existing law, a man is conclusively presumed to be the father of a child if he was married to and cohabiting with the child’s mother, except as specified. Existing law also provides that if a man signs a voluntary declaration of paternity, it has the force and effect of a judgment of paternity, subject to certain exceptions. Existing law provides that these presumptions are rebuttable.
This bill would state that a person’s offer or refusal to sign a voluntary declaration of paternity may be considered as a factor, but shall not be determinative as to the issue of legal parentage in any proceedings regarding the establishment or termination of parental rights.
Existing law requires a nonattorney surrogacy facilitator to direct his or her client to deposit client funds in an independent, bonded escrow account or a trust account maintained by an attorney, subject to specified withdrawal requirements.
This bill would additionally require a nonattorney donor facilitator to direct his or her client to deposit client funds, as specified above.
